# My Lists of Basic Terms for Learning Mandarin

This is a collection of vocabulary lists I've put together. 
The only common factor is that I found these collections of words compelling or interesting in some way.

Translations come mostly from [MDBG](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary) and conversations with my wife.

## Translations of Minimal English

I wanted to find list of words that would let me discuss concepts without knowing the specific word for that concept.

[Minimal English](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/schools-departments/natural-semantic-metalanguage/what-is-nsm) is an attempt to compile a set of words and grammar which are in some sense maximally translatable. The idea then is that the core translation can be used to define more complex terms. 
The examples of basic translation they give are rather awkward and stilted. But I can admire the project as an art piece, and the set of words they came up with is conceptually close to what I was looking for.


### Semantic Primes

*Semantic Primes* are what the authors of Minimal English call a set of concepts which:
 - Everyone in the world understands, and
 - which are difficult or even impossible to define in more simple terms. 
 
 How do you define "Me"? You point at yourself while saying it. 
 
The author's of Minimal English provided [a translation list of these terms into Chinese](https://intranet.secure.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/word_doc/0032/345992/Chinese_Table_Primes_Final_YE_07_11_2016.docx), and the list below is based on the linked list, but with some slight differences and some additional clarifications.
