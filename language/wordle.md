# Pre-calculated Solution Paths for Wordle.

This is not a *solver* for [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

This is a precalculated tree of solutions for Wordle. 
<!--Don't believe me? Disable javascript and you can still use the tool below.-->

1. Start with the guess **"RAISE"**
2. Look at the sequence of squares that Wordle gives you after entering that clue.
3. Find the matching sequence of squares in the list below.
4. Click on it. The element will expand with instructions on what your next guess should be.

If you follow this tree of guesses exactly, you will always be able to solve Wordle in 5 guesses or fewer *(assuming Wordle hasn't changed the list it draws words from)*.
<!--*(given the same list of 2315 potential solutions which Wordle draws from as of Feb 08 of 2022)*.-->

If you stray from this path, there is nothing I can to help you.



GHPAGES was failing to build. Was it just because it didn't like my ginormous set of nested detail elements?

<details><summary>⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛</summary><div class='sublist'>
<p>Your next guess should be "<b>blond</b>".</p>
<p>If that is not the solution, find the response to "<b>blond</b>" in the list below.</p>
<div class="sublist">
<details><summary>⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛</summary><div class='sublist'>
<p>Your next guess should be "<b>humph</b>".</p>
<p>If that is not the solution, find the response to "<b>humph</b>" in the list below.</p>
</div></details></div></details>
