Regression (statistics)
: Francis Galton was studying how tall people tend to have children shorter than they are. Their descendants' heights 'regress'. From this was coined the term *regression to the mean*, and from there 'regression' grew to refer to any of a broad array of techniques for studying the relationships between variables.


Capital and per-capita
: Both derive from the latin *capita*, meaning *head*. 'Per-capita' refers to human heads, of course. While 'Capital' refers to heads of cattle, which would now be classified as a specific kind of capital, falling under the category of [cultivated biological resources](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6380).






Soup
: Originally refering to *suppa*, the bread soaked in broth.

Stew
: Originally meaning a steam bath.

Salad
: From vulgar latin *salata*, meaning *salted*. Short for *herba salata*, meaning salted herbs. A pile of gherkins? Totally a salad.
