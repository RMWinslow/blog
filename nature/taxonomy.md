# Monophyletic Taxonomy

An educated person might think that whales are fish.  
An educated person knows that whales aren't fish; they're mammals.  
A pedantic person knows that whales *are* fish because *all mammals* are fish.  
The enlightened individual knows that there is [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhwcEvMJz1Y)

So goes the internet discourse. 
Pufferfish, you see, share a more recent ancestor with humans than they do with sharks.
Hence any group consisting of only the things called 'fish' is a group defined by appearance rather than ancestry.
Fish, in other words, are a *non-monophyletic grouping*; they aren't a true *clade*.  

(Along similar lines: a penguin is a dinosaur, and hence a reptile, and hence a fish.)

These kinds of discussions are somewhat silly, but I do think thinking about the tree of life in terms of 
[clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade) can be a fun and enlightening exercise.

After all, we used to think of reptiles and amphibians as the same kind of thing. And it was only in the last century that people reaized that mushrooms aren't plants.

If you were to partially categorize the vertebrates using only monophyletic groups, 
and avoiding most of the fancy latin terminology, 
you could come up with a tree that looks something like this:


### Clades of Fishes:

- Jawless Fishes: hagfish, lampreys
- Cartilaginous Fishes: sharks, rays
- Bony Fishes
    - Ray-finned Fishes: trout, seahorses, &c.
    - Lobe-finned Fishes:
        - Coelacanths
        - Lungfish
        - **Tetrapods** *(Greek for "Four Legs")*

### Clades of Tetrapods:

- Amphibians
- Mammals:
    - Monotremes: platypuses, echidnas
    - Marsupials: kangaroos, possums, &c.
    - **Placentals** 
- Reptiles
    - Tuatara
    - Squamates: lizards, snakes
    - Turtles
    - Crocodilians
    - Birds
        - Ratites, including Tinamous: those weird birds that have trouble with the whole flying concept. You know the ones.
        - Fowl: chickens, ducks)
        - Newbirds (crows, eagles, penguins, all the normal birds)

### Clades of Placentals:

- Afrotherians *(latin for "African Beasts")*: A grab-bag of animals nobody thought were related, including the elephant, the dugong, the aardvark, and some shrews.
- Armadillos
- Pilosans *(latin for "furries")*: anteaters, sloths
- Supraprimates
    - Lagomorphs (hare, rabbit)
    - Rodents (rat, beaver, capybara)
    - Treeshrews
    - Colugo
    - Primates
- Bats
- Eulipotyphlans ("Truly fat and blind")
- Ungulates:
    - Odd-toed ungulates: equids, tapirs, rhinos
    - Even-toed ungulates:  
        - Camels
        - Giraffes
        - Pigs
        - Ruminants
        - Whippos  
- Pangolins
- Carnivorans:
    - Caniforms
    - Feliforms
