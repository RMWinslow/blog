# Monophyletic Taxonomy

An educated person might think that whales are fish.  
An educated person knows that whales aren't fish; they're mammals.  
A pedantic person knows that whales *are* fish because *all mammals* are fish.  
The enlightened individual knows that there is [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhwcEvMJz1Y)

So goes the internet discourse. 
Pufferfish, you see, share a more recent ancestor with humans than they do with sharks.
Hence any group consisting of only the things called 'fish' is a group defined by appearance rather than ancestry.
Fish, in other words, are a *non-monophyletic grouping*; they aren't a true *clade*.  

(Along similar lines: a penguin is a dinosaur, and hence a reptile, and hence a fish.)

These kinds of discussions are somewhat silly, but I do think thinking about the tree of life in terms of 
[clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade) can be a fun and enlightening exercise.

After all, we used to think of reptiles and amphibians as the same thing. And it was only in the last century that people reaized that mushrooms aren't plants.

If you were to partially categorize the vertebrates using only monophyletic groups, 
and avoiding most of the fancy latin terminology, 
you could come up with a tree that looks something like this:


### Vertabrate Clades

- Jawless Fish (hagfish, lampreys)
- Cartilaginous Fish (sharks, rays)
- Bony Fish
    - Ray-finned Fish (trout, seahorses)
    - Lobe-finned Fish
        - Coelacanths
        - Lungfish
        - Tetrapods (That includes you!)

### Tetrapod Clades

- Amphibians
- Mammals
    - Monotremes (platypus, echidna)
    - Marsupials (kangaroo, possum)
    - Placentals (humans included)
- Reptiles
    - Tuatara
    - Squamates (lizards and snakes)
    - Turtles
    - Crocodilians
    - Dinosaurs
        - Ratites and Tinamous (those weird birds that have trouble flying. You know the ones)
        - Fowl (chickens, ducks)
        - Newbirds (crows, eagles, penguins, all the normal birds)

### Placental Clades

- Afrotheria (meaning "African Beasts") (A grab-bag of animals nobody thought were related, including the elephant, the dugong, the aardvark, and some shrews)
- Armadillos
- Pilosans (anteaters and sloths)
- Supraprimates
    - Lagomorphs (hare, rabbit)
    - Rodents (rat, beaver, capybara)
    - Treeshrews
    - Colugo
    - Primates
- Bats
- Eulipotyphla ("Truly fat and blind")
- Ungulates (whale, goat, horse)
- Pangolins
