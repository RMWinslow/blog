# Monophyletic Taxonomy

An uneducated person might think that whales are fish.  
An educated person knows that whales aren't fish; they're mammals.  
A fan of the show *QI* knows that there is [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhwcEvMJz1Y).   
The enlighted pedant knows that whales *are* fish because *all mammals* are fish.  

So goes the internet discourse. 

Pufferfish, you see, share a more recent ancestor with humans than they do with sharks.
Any group consisting of only the things called '[fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish)' is a group defined by physical features rather than shared ancestry.
Fish, in other words, are a *non-monophyletic grouping*; they aren't a true *clade*.

<!--Maybe put the clade definition in an aside-->

These kinds of discussions are somewhat silly, but thinking about the tree of life in terms of 
[clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade) can be a fun and enlightening exercise.
After all, we used to think of reptiles and amphibians as the same kind of thing. 
And it was only in the last century that people realized that mushrooms aren't plants.

<!--Insert graphics here. Aside with Lupo's comment about how none of the groupings are wrong per se just useless.-->


## Examples of non-monophyletic groupings

A clade is any group of organisms which share a common ancestor, such that all of the descendants of that common ancestor are included in the group.

### Para-phyla

Fishes (Vertebrata)
: Fish are not a clade. The common ancestor of sharks, tuna, hagfish, and lungfish, is also the ancestor of tetrapods (reptiles, birds, mammals, and amphibians; all typically four-limbed land creatures). *Vertebra* is the name for the clade which includes tetrapods and fish, and its members are called *vertebrates*. 
: Thus fish, as usually defined, is the group consisting of *non-tetrapod vertebrates*. 

If you wanted to expand the clade to include everything that is sometimes *called* a fish (jellyfish, inkfish, starfish), you would need to include basically every animal excepts sponges.

<!--African lungfish look eerily similar to tetrapods, with their four tendril-like fins which they use to crawl around in the mud.-->

Dinos (Dinosauria)
: Likewise, dinosaurs, as the category exists in the imagination of children and film-makers, are not a clade. It's only once birds are included that the category of *dinosauria* becomes cladistic.
: Hence why dinos, as they appear in pop-culture, are called *non-avian dinosaurs* by science educators.

Sidenote: Pterosaurs aren't in the clade of dinosauria, but they're more closely related to dinosaurs than they are to anything else, so I think it's perfectly reasonable to include them in the pop-culture category of dinos. But if you want a more proper name, the clade containing both dinosaurs and pterosaurs is called  *[Panaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avemetatarsalia)*, meaning 'every bird', or *Avemetatarsalia*, meaning 'bird-footbones'. Eugh. Those names are both boring an confusing. I much prefer Ernst Haeckel's suggestion that the clade by called 
[dracones](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Systematische_Phylogenie_Wirbelthiere/ZXxZAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=dracones+Haeckel,+1895&pg=PR17&printsec=frontcover),
which is just latin for 'dragons'. 


<!--anything closer to a bird than to a crocodile-->


Antelopes (Bovidae)
: Antelopes are not a clade<!--, unless we restrict the term to only mean "[True Antelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopinae)"-->. The clade which contains antelopes is called *Bovidae*, and its members are called *bovids*, which means 'cattle-like'. Cows are bovids, of course. So are sheep, goats, and musk ox. An antelope is simply any bovid which people don't care enough about to lump it into its own category.
: I suppose you could cheekily define antelope as *non-algricultural bovids*, meaning bovid genera which are not commonly tamed and domesticated. 
: The clade becomes even more expansive if Pronghorns are included. Pronghorns are often called American Antelope or Pronghorn Antelope. But they aren't even bovids; Pronghorn are their own thing, more closely related to giraffes. The clade which includes both bovids and pronghorns is called *Pecora*, which, like *bovidae*, can be translated as 'cattle-like'. Deer and giraffes are also pecorans. 
: So an antelope in the broadest sense is anything related to cattle which isn't similar enough to cattle to be called cattle, but which isn't different enough to be called something else. ðŸ¤·

Lizards (Squamata)
: Lizards are not a clade. Snakes are a clade. So are [amphisbaenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphisbaenia). All three of these types of critters are called *squamates* in the order *squamata*. 
: A lizard is any non-snake, non-amphisbaenian squamate.

This one seems like it might be a reasonable category; snakes and amphisbaenians are both [mostly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GhSOD6CTWA&t=140s) legless, so a lizard is just a squamate that still has its legs, right? Well no, there are loads of legless lizards. As described by a professional reptile nerd [in this amusing rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWPqXlxnki0), there are over twenty lineages of legless lizards, so it seems bizarre that these two in particular are excluded as not being lizardy enough for the lizard club. You know what? His rant is convincing. Snakes *are* lizards; anyone who tells you otherwise is a fool. *hashtag lizard unity hashtag snakesarelizards*

Conversely, [tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara) look super lizardy, and used to be considered lizards, but aren't part of the squamate clade. Biologists stopped calling them lizards when they noticed that while they do share some traits with lizards, they also share some traits with crocodiles (spiny plates) and turtles (beak instead of teeth). Tuatara are now thought to be the only surviving members of the [beakheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynchocephalia), a sort of sister clade to the lizards. Together, the squamates and beakheads form the clade of *Lepidosaurs*. And for the purposes of this exercise, it doesn't really matter whether we use "lizard" to refer to Squamata or Lepidosauria; both are clades full of lizardy things.
 



### Poly-phyla (Some more tenouous examples)


Shrews / Mammals

Deer / Ruminants

Worms / Bilateral creatures. <!--Non-snake cylidrical bilaterians?-->

(Along similar lines: a penguin is a dinosaur, and hence a reptile, and hence a fish.)

If you were to partially categorize the vertebrates using only monophyletic groups, 
playing a bit fast and loose with terms,
and avoiding most of the fancy latin terminology, 
you could come up with a tree that looks something like this:


### Clades of Fishes:

- Jawless Fishes: hagfish, lampreys
- Cartilaginous Fishes: sharks, rays
- Bony Fishes
    - Ray-finned Fishes: trout, seahorses, &c.
    - Lobe-finned Fishes:
        - Coelacanths
        - Lungfish
        - **Tetrapods** *(Greek for "Four Legs")*

### Clades of Tetrapods:

- Amphibians
- Mammals:
    - Monotremes: platypuses, echidnas
    - Marsupials: kangaroos, possums, &c.
    - ~~**Placentals**~~ Shrews 
- Reptiles
    - Tuatara
    - Lizards, including snakes.
    - Turtles
    - Crocodilians
    - Birds
        - Ratites, including Tinamous: those weird birds that have trouble with the whole flying concept. You know the ones.
        - Fowl: chickens, ducks)
        - Newbirds (crows, eagles, penguins, all the normal birds)

### Clades of ~~Placentals~~ Shrews:

- Afrotherians *(latin for "African Beasts")*: A grab-bag of animals nobody thought were related, including the elephant, the dugong, the aardvark, and some shrews.
- Armadillos
- Pilosans *(latin for "furries")*: anteaters, sloths
- Supraprimates
    - Lagomorphs (hare, rabbit)
    - Rodents (rat, beaver, capybara)
    - Treeshrews
    - Colugo
    - Primates
- Bats
- Eulipotyphlans ("Truly fat and blind"): Hedgehogs et. al. Shrews here too.
- Ungulates:
    - Odd-toed ungulates: equids, tapirs, rhinos
    - Even-toed ungulates:  
        - Camels
        - Giraffes
        - Pigs
        - Ruminants
        - Whippos  
- Pangolins
- Carnivorans:
    - Caniforms
    - Feliforms
