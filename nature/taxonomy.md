# Monophyletic Taxonomy

An uneducated person might think that whales are fish.  
An educated person knows that whales aren't fish; they're mammals.  
A fan of the show *QI* knows that there is [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhwcEvMJz1Y).
The enlighted pedant knows that whales *are* fish because *all mammals* are fish.  

So goes the internet discourse. 

Pufferfish, you see, share a more recent ancestor with humans than they do with sharks.
Any group consisting of only the things called '[fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish)' is a group defined by physical features rather than shared ancestry.
Fish, in other words, are a *non-monophyletic grouping*; they aren't a true *clade*.

These kinds of discussions are somewhat silly, but thinking about the tree of life in terms of 
[clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade) can be a fun and enlightening exercise.
After all, we used to think of reptiles and amphibians as the same kind of thing. 
And it was only in the last century that people decided/reaized that mushrooms aren't plants.


## Examples of non-monophyletic groupings

A clade is any group of organisms which share a common ancestor, such that all of the descendants of that common ancestor are included in the group.

Fish (Vertebra)
: Fish are not a clade. The common ancestor of sharks, tuna, hagfish, and lungfish, is also the ancestor of tetrapods (reptiles, birds, mammals, and amphibians; all typically four-limbed land creatures). *Vertebra* is the name for the clade which includes tetrapods and fish, and its members are called *vertebrates*. If you wanted to expand the clade to include everything that is sometimes *called* a fish (jellyfish, inkfish, starfish), you would need to include basically every animal excepts sponges.
: Thus fish, as usually defined, is the group consisting of *non-tetrapod vertebrates*.

<--African lungfish look eerily similar to tetrapods, with their four tendril-like fins which they use to crawl around in the mud.-->

Dinos (Dinosauria)
: Likewise, dinosaurs, as the category exists in the imagination of children and film-makers, are not a clade. It's only once birds are included that the category of *dinosauria* becomes cladistic.
: Thus dinos, as they appear in pop-culture, are called *non-avian dinosaurs* by science educators.






(Along similar lines: a penguin is a dinosaur, and hence a reptile, and hence a fish.)

If you were to partially categorize the vertebrates using only monophyletic groups, 
playing a bit fast and loose with terms,
and avoiding most of the fancy latin terminology, 
you could come up with a tree that looks something like this:


### Clades of Fishes:

- Jawless Fishes: hagfish, lampreys
- Cartilaginous Fishes: sharks, rays
- Bony Fishes
    - Ray-finned Fishes: trout, seahorses, &c.
    - Lobe-finned Fishes:
        - Coelacanths
        - Lungfish
        - **Tetrapods** *(Greek for "Four Legs")*

### Clades of Tetrapods:

- Amphibians
- Mammals:
    - Monotremes: platypuses, echidnas
    - Marsupials: kangaroos, possums, &c.
    - ~~**Placentals**~~ Shrews 
- Reptiles
    - Tuatara
    - Lizards, including snakes.
    - Turtles
    - Crocodilians
    - Birds
        - Ratites, including Tinamous: those weird birds that have trouble with the whole flying concept. You know the ones.
        - Fowl: chickens, ducks)
        - Newbirds (crows, eagles, penguins, all the normal birds)

### Clades of ~~Placentals~~ Shrews:

- Afrotherians *(latin for "African Beasts")*: A grab-bag of animals nobody thought were related, including the elephant, the dugong, the aardvark, and some shrews.
- Armadillos
- Pilosans *(latin for "furries")*: anteaters, sloths
- Supraprimates
    - Lagomorphs (hare, rabbit)
    - Rodents (rat, beaver, capybara)
    - Treeshrews
    - Colugo
    - Primates
- Bats
- Eulipotyphlans ("Truly fat and blind"): Hedgehogs et. al. Shrews here too.
- Ungulates:
    - Odd-toed ungulates: equids, tapirs, rhinos
    - Even-toed ungulates:  
        - Camels
        - Giraffes
        - Pigs
        - Ruminants
        - Whippos  
- Pangolins
- Carnivorans:
    - Caniforms
    - Feliforms
