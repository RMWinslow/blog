## The Dwarf Planets




<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Planet</th>
<th>Features</th>
<th>Namesake</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Ceres<br>⚳</td>
<td>Largest asteroid. Made of clay and brine. Cryovolcanoes. Originally considered a planet. (Pluto is not unique in that regard.) There's a dead satellite orbitting around it.</td>
<td>mythos</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Pluto<br>♇<br><small>alt: ⯓⯔⯕⯖⯡</small></td>

<td>mythos (And no, I don't know why the unicode standard includes 5 variant symbols for Pluto.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Haumea<br></td>
<td>Spins so fast it's egg-shaped. Tiny little rings.</td>
<td>mythos</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Makemake<br></td>
<td>planetdesc</td>
<td>Lead god of the birdman cult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Eris<br>⯰<br><small>(alt: ⯱)</small></td>
<td>Incredibly distant from the Sun. Ever slightly more massive than Pluto, which led to the controversial decision to reclassify Pluto as Dwarf Planet. <i>(Personally, I liked Asimov's terminology suggestion of "Major Planet" for the big 8, "Minor Planet" for peedy things like comets and asteroids, and "Mesoplanet" for the Plutos and Ceress of the the system.)</i></td>
<td>God of strife and discord. Kickstarted the Trojan War with the apple incident. </td>
</tr>
</table>










## Planetary Mass Moons

Aka "satellite planets".
The word "moon" originally just referred to Luna, the moon of earth, and comes from a Proto-Indo-European word related to timekeeping and the month.

Here are the moons bigger than Pluto, and which would at the very least be classified as dwarf planets were they not orbiting around another body (in fact, Titan and Ganymede are even bigger than Mercury):


<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Moon</th>
<th>Features</th>
<th>Namesake</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Luna<br>☾</td>
<td>Tides and whatnot. It's *the* Moon. </td>
<td>God of the Moon. A bit redundant, I know. Often identified with Diana, god of the hunt, or Juno, god of marriage and childbirth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Io<br>
<span style="font-family:moonsymbols;">I</span>
<br><small>(♃-I)</small></td>
<td>Least water of anywhere in the solar system. Sulfur atmosphere. Hundreds of volcanoes. Sulfur crust. Spews out plumes of sulfurous crud all the way into space. The crud is then accelerated by Jupiter's magnetic field to form the deadly radiation torus.</td>
<td>Lusted after by Jupiter, turned into a cow, tormented by a gadfly. Eventually got turned back to normal and married a king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Europa<br>
<span style="font-family:moonsymbols;">E</span>
<small><br>(♃-II)</small></td>
<td>Smooth surface of cracked water ice, dotted with "chaos terrains". Bombarded by deadly radiation. Thin oxygen atmosphere (created by the radiation). Oceans under kilometers of ice. Promising spot for extraterrestial life.</td>
<td>This time, Jupiter turned his own dang self into a bovine, rode off with this lovely lady, and wooed her with the gifts of: a pet dog, a homing javelin, and a giant fighting robot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym"><small>Ganymede</small><br>
<span style="font-family:moonsymbols;">G</span>
<small><br>(♃-III)</small></td>
<td>Biggest moon. Has its own magnetic field. More water than earth, held in a subterranean ocean 100km deep (or maybe multiple layered oceans). *Very* thin oxygen atmosphere.</td>
<td>Really pretty guy. Abducted by Jupiter in bird form. Made immortal to serve as Juipter's personal cupbearer and boytoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Callisto<br>
<span style="font-family:moonsymbols;">KC</span>
<small><br>(♃-IV)</small></td>
<td>Lots of craters. Outside of the deadly radiation donut, so might be the best place near Jupiter to set up a human base. (Also, might have subterranean oceans. That's apparently pretty common in space.)</td>
<td>A nymph and follower of Diana. Jupiter raped her, then Artemis kicked her out because she wasn't a virgin anymore. A while later, Juno turned her into a bear, and then her own son hunted her down in bear form. Yeesh. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Titan<br>
<span style="font-family:moonsymbols;">T</span>
<small><br>(♄-VI)</small></td>
<td>2nd biggest moon. Thicker atmosphere than Earth's. Very hazy. Only place besides Earth with surface liquid (it's methane though), and thus the only place besides Earth to have whirlpools. Also might have an ammonia-water ocean underground, which erupts from cryovolcanoes. Soft crunchy surface. Permanent polar hurricances.<!--Victor of a clash between moons.--></td>
<td>Precursors to the Olympian gods. Not any specific titan, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Triton<br>
<span style="font-family:moonsymbols;">R</span>
<br><small>(♆-I)</small></td>
<td>Backwards, tilted orbit. Possibly a captured dwarf planet. Covered in nitrogen ice, similar composition to Pluto. Cryvolcanoes stain the surface with organic compounds. Thin nitrogen and methane atmosphere.</td>
<td>Son of Neptune. Merman with a magic conch.</td>
</tr>
</table>




And here are a few more bigger than Ceres, big enough to probably count as dwarf planets, even if they aren't as dramatically large as the previous list.

## Asteroids

People initially thought these were planets and gave them symbols. Around the discovery of 16 Psyche is when astronomers realized there are too many of the dang things to dote on each one individually.

1. ⚳ Ceres: God of grain, harvest, motherhood.
2. ⚴ Pallas: Athena and her spear.
3. ⚵ Juno: God of marriage and childbirth.
4. ⚶ Vesta: God of hearth and home.
5. Astraea: God of justice, innocence, purity, and precision.
6. Hebe: God of youth and forgiveness, Cupbearer to the gods.
7. Iris: God of rainbows. Messenger of the gods.
8. Flora: God of flowers and springtime.
9. Metis: Titan of wisdom and skilled council. Mother of Athena.
10. Hygiea: God of cleanliness, sanitation, and preventative medicine.
11. Parthenope: Siren. Either failed to lure Odysseus or was turned into a city by Jupiter.
12. Victoria: God of victory.
13. Egeria: 
14. Irene
15. Eunomia
16. Psyche
17. Thetis
18. Melpomene
19. Fortuna
26. Proserpina
28. Bellona
29. Amphitrite
35. Leukothea
37. Fides
