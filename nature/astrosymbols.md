## Planetary Mass Moons

Aka "satellite planets".
The word "moon" originally just referred to Luna, the moon of earth, and comes from a Proto-Indo-European word related to timekeeping and the month.

Here are the moons bigger than Pluto, and which would at the very least be classified as dwarf planets were they not orbiting around another body (in fact, Titan and Ganymede are even bigger than Mercury):

And here are a few more bigger than Ceres, big enough to probably count as dwarf planets, even if they aren't as dramatically large as the previous list.
