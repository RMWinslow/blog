## The Eight Major Planets

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Planet</th>
<th>Features</th>
<th>Namesake</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Mercury<br>☿</td>
<td>Tidally locked. Extreme temperatures. Very close to sun. Moves really fast around the sun. Closest planet to Earth (on average) yet also the most difficult to reach.</td>
<td>God of commerce and communication (and thieves and trickery). Guides souls to the underworld. Questionable fashion accessories. In Mandarin, called "water planet". Associated with the element mercury by alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Venus<br>♀</td>
<td>Blisteringly hot, thick atmosphere. Clouds made of sulfuric acid.</td>
<td>God of love, prosperity, beauty, desire. Sometimes a god of war. Sometimes acts a bit bonkers. Started the Trojan war to win an apple. Symbol is just a modified ϕ (short for Phosphorus).  In Mandarin, called "metal planet". Associated with copper by alchemists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Terra<br>⊕<br><small>alt: ♁</small></td>
<td>Liquid water surface oceans. Exotic slimes.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Mars<br>♂</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Jupiter<br>♃<br><small>alt: ⯢</small></td>

## The Dwarf Planets


<i>(Personally, I liked Asimov's terminology suggestion of "Major Planet" for the big 8, "Minor Planet" for peedie things like comets and asteroids, and "Mesoplanet" for the Plutos and Cereses of the the system.)</i>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Planet</th>
<th>Features</th>
<th>Namesake</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Ceres<br>⚳</td>
<td>Largest asteroid. Made of clay and brine. Cryovolcanoes. Originally considered a planet. (Pluto is not unique in that regard.) There's a dead satellite orbitting around it. Has the water and organic compounds needed for life, but is far too cold and small for any chance of life occuring in Ceres' past.</td>
<td>God of the harvest, agriculture, and especially grain. Hates pigs. Winter happens when her daughter goes to the underworld. Guards the barrier between life and death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Pluto<br>♇<br><small>alt: ⯓⯔⯕⯖⯡</small></td>
<td>Widest (but not most massive) object in the Kuiper belt. Weird tilted orbit.  Big heart-shaped plain of solid nitrogen the size of Texas. Equitorial dark spots made of tholins (space tar), the biggest of which is called "Cthulhu Macula". Mountains made of water ice. Thin hazy atmosphere. May have had liquid nitrogen lakes and subsurface water oceans in the past. (And yes, the unicode standard includes 5 variant symbols for Pluto.)</td>
<td>Ruler of the underworld. God of mineral wealth. Kidnapped Ceres' daughter, who must now stay in the underworld each winter because she ate an underworldly pomegranate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Haumea<br></td>
<td>Spins so fast it's egg-shaped. Tiny little rings. Both of these features are the result of the planet's history as the product of a violent collision between multiple objects.</td>
<td>Fertility god who gave humans the ability to give birth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Makemake<br></td>
<td>It's kinda red, but not, like, super red. Red-tinged and covered in pellets of solid methane. Not as much nitrogen as Pluto or Triton.</td>
<td>Lead god of the birdman cult. Associated with a proxy-war-like ritual involving a deadly race to collect the first tern egg of the season.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Eris<br>⯰<br><small>(alt: ⯱)</small></td>
<td>Incredibly distant from the Sun. Ever slightly more massive than Pluto, which led to the controversial decision to reclassify Pluto as Dwarf Planet. </td>
<td>God of strife and discord. Kickstarted the Trojan War with the apple incident. </td>
</tr>
</table>


And the following are a few of the objects most likely to be dwarf planets, which haven't been recognized by the IAU as such:

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Planet</th>
<th>Features</th>
<th>Namesake</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Orcus<br></td>
<td>Called the "anti-Pluto" because it's orbit is similar to Pluto's, yet opposite from it.   They are both resonant with neptune and have the same orbital period. Both of them cross over Neptune's orbit. But Pluto is close to the sun when Orcus is far away and vice versa. Also, both have a relatively large tidally locked moon, named after psychopomps. </td>
<td>Underworld god and punisher of broken oaths. Namesake of ogres, orcs, and orcas.It's moon, Vanth, is named after another psychopomp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Quaoar<br></td>
<td>Its icy shell was stripped away in a past collision.</td>
<td>Sang and danced the cosmos into being. Wild animals enforce his will.<!--https://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/ca/bosc/bosc04.htm--></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Gonggong<br>	共</td>
<td>Just barely big enough to hold onto volatile compounds..</td>
<td>Jerkwad serpent who knocked the earth off kilter. Also prone to causing floods, and his 9-headed sidekick had his teeth kicked in by Da Yu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Sedna<br>⯲</td>
<td>Almost as red as the planet Mars. Listen, they can't all be fascinating worlds with exciting geology and the potential for life. Sometimes it's a rock just really far away and all we know about it is a vague sense of its color.</td>
<td>God of the sea and sea creatures. Maybe she married a dog. Maybe she married a bird in disguise. Maybe she refused to marry anyone. The story varies. One way  or another, she lost her fingers, which turned into sea mammals.</td>
</tr>
</table>








## Planetary Mass Moons

Aka "satellite planets".
The word "moon" originally just referred to Luna, the moon of earth, and comes from a Proto-Indo-European word related to timekeeping and the month.

Here are the moons bigger than Pluto, and which would at the very least be classified as dwarf planets were they not orbiting around another body (in fact, Titan and Ganymede are even bigger than Mercury):


<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Moon</th>
<th>Features</th>
<th>Namesake</th>
</tr></thead>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Luna<br>☾</td>
<td>Tides and whatnot. It's *the* Moon. Likely the result of a massive collision between Earth and another planet, the same collision that gave earth its oceans.</td>
<td>God of the Moon. A bit redundant, I know. Often identified with Diana, god of the hunt, or Juno, god of marriage and childbirth. The Moon is mythologically associated with wolves, madness, womanhood, and shellfish. Or at least, it used to be. The shellfish association kinda disappeared from pop culture for some reason. Alchemists associated it with silver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Io<br>
<span class="moonsym">I</span>
<br><small>(♃-I)</small></td>
<td>Least water of anywhere in the solar system. Sulfur atmosphere. Hundreds of volcanoes. Sulfur crust. Spews out plumes of sulfurous crud all the way into space. The crud is then accelerated by Jupiter's magnetic field to form the deadly radiation torus.</td>
<td>Lusted after by Jupiter, turned into a cow, tormented by a gadfly. Eventually got turned back to normal and married a king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Europa<br>
<span class="moonsym">E</span>
<small><br>(♃-II)</small></td>
<td>Smooth surface of cracked water ice, dotted with "chaos terrains". Bombarded by deadly radiation. Thin oxygen atmosphere (created by the radiation). Oceans under kilometers of ice. Promising spot for extraterrestial life.</td>
<td>This time, Jupiter turned his own dang self into a bovine, rode off with this lovely lady, and wooed her with the gifts of: a pet dog, a homing javelin, and a giant fighting robot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym"><small>Ganymede</small><br>
<span class="moonsym">G</span>
<small><br>(♃-III)</small></td>
<td>Biggest moon. Has its own magnetic field. More water than earth, held in a subterranean ocean 100km deep (or maybe multiple layered oceans). *Very* thin oxygen atmosphere.</td>
<td>Really pretty guy. Abducted by Jupiter in bird form. Made immortal to serve as Juipter's personal cupbearer and boytoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Callisto<br>
<span class="moonsym">K</span>
<small><br>(♃-IV)</small></td>
<td>Lots of craters. Outside of the deadly radiation donut, so might be the best place near Jupiter to set up a human base. (Also, might have subterranean oceans. That's apparently pretty common in space.)</td>
<td>A nymph and follower of Diana. Jupiter raped her, then Artemis kicked her out because she wasn't a virgin anymore. A while later, Juno turned her into a bear, and then her own son hunted her down in bear form. Yeesh. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Titan<br>
<span class="moonsym">T</span>
<small><br>(♄-VI)</small></td>
<td>2nd biggest moon. Thicker atmosphere than Earth's. Very hazy. Only place besides Earth with surface liquid (it's methane though), and thus the only place besides Earth to have whirlpools. Also might have an ammonia-water ocean underground, which erupts from cryovolcanoes. Soft crunchy surface. Permanent polar hurricances.<!--Victor of a clash between moons.--></td>
<td>Precursors to the Olympian gods. Not any specific titan, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Triton<br>
<span class="moonsym">R</span>
<br><small>(♆-I)</small></td>
<td>Backwards, tilted orbit. Possibly a captured dwarf planet. Covered in nitrogen ice, similar composition to Pluto. Cryvolcanoes stain the surface with organic compounds. Thin nitrogen and methane atmosphere.</td>
<td>Son of Neptune. Merman with a magic conch.</td>
</tr>
</table>



<!--Callisto and its oceans of piss.-->


And here are a few more bigger than Ceres, big enough to probably count as dwarf planets, even if they aren't as dramatically large as the previous list.

And you know, what the heck? Enceladus is teeny tiny, but it's interesting enough to include. So throw that one in the list too.

<span class="moonsym">d</span>
<br><small>(♃-IV)</small></td>
<td>Networks of icy cliffs. <!--Possible subsurface liquid oceans? Hard to find mention of that outside wikipedia though?--> Resonant with Enceladus and its features might be more "mature" versions of that little moon's. Also, constantly bombarded with icey powder from Enceladus.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="catsym">Iapetus<br>
<span class="moonsym">i</span>

<td class="catsym">Charon<br>⯕<br><small>(♇-I)</small></td>
<td>A moon big enough and close enough to Pluto make their center of gravity lie between the two.</td>

<td class="catsym">Vulcan</td>
<td>Urbain Le Verrier famously predicted the existence of Neptune through irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. He also predicted the existence of this planet through the irregularities in the orbit of Mercury. Alas, Vulcan doesn't exist. Rather, the irregularities are explained by general relativity.</td>

## The Minor Planets

These are now called "small solar system bodies".

People initially thought these were planets and gave them symbols. Around the discovery of 16 Psyche is when astronomers realized there are too many of the dang things to dote on each one individually.

1. ⚳ Ceres: God of grain, harvest, motherhood.
2. ⚴ Pallas: Athena and her spear.
3. ⚵ Juno: God of marriage and childbirth.
4. ⚶ Vesta: God of hearth and home. (Asteroid has the tallest mountain in the system.)
5. Astraea: God of justice, innocence, purity, and precision.
6. Hebe: God of youth and forgiveness, Cupbearer to the gods.
7. Iris: God of rainbows. Messenger of the gods.
8. Flora: God of flowers and springtime.
9. Metis: Titan of wisdom and skilled council. Mother of Athena.
10. Hygiea: God of cleanliness, sanitation, and preventative medicine.
11. Parthenope: Siren. Either failed to lure Odysseus or was turned into a city by Jupiter.
12. Victoria: God of victory.
13. Egeria: 
14. Irene
15. Eunomia
16. Psyche
17. Thetis
18. Melpomene
19. Fortuna
26. Proserpina
28. Bellona
29. Amphitrite
35. Leukothea
37. Fides





2 Pallas
⚴	Athena and her spear. A lot of other mythological characters are named Pallas as well.
3 Juno
⚵	God of marriage and childbirth. Sometimes associated with the moon.
4 Vesta
⚶	

" Around the time this asteroid was discovered, people realized there's tons of the things and started numbering them instead of giving them unique names and symbols"


- <span class="catsym">1 Ceres ⚳</span>: God of grain, harvest, motherhood. Biggest Asteroid. First discovered. Now considered a dwarf Planet, listed above.
- <span class="catsym">2 Pallas ⚴</span>: Athena and her spear. A lot of other mythological characters are named Pallas as well. The asteroid is is the third most massive, as dark as asphalt, and on a highly tilted orbit.
- <span class="catsym">3 Juno ⚵</span>: God of marriage and childbirth. Sometimes associated with the moon.
- <span class="catsym">4 Vesta ⚶</span>: God of hearth and home. This asteroid is the second most massive, and is a surviving rocky protoplanet, like the frozen embryo of a terrestrial world. About a billion years ago, it suffered from two giant impacts. The splash from one of these impacts gave Vesta a mountain to rival Olympus Mons. And the debris from the impact was scattered throughout the solar system (5% of meteorites that hit Earth are chunks of Vesta).
- <span class="catsym">5 Astraea <span class="catPUA"></span>⯙</span>: God of justice, innocence, purity, and precision.
- <span class="catsym">6 Hebe <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: God of youth and forgiveness, Cupbearer to the gods.

- <span class="catsym">10 Hygiea <span class="catPUA"></span>⯚</span>: God of cleanliness, sanitation, and preventative medicine. Daughter of Asclepius, god of medicine. I think the official unicode glyph is supposed to be a rod of Asclepius (one snake), but looks more like a caduceus (two snakes, Hermes) to me. 4th largest asteroid.
- <span class="catsym">11 Parthenope <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: Siren Either failed to lure Odysseus or was turned into a city by Jupiter.
- <span class="catsym">12 Victoria <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: God of victory.

- <span class="catsym">16 Psyche <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: God of the soul. A beautiful mortal who married Cupid and was tormented by his mother Venus. The symbol is supposed to be a butterfly's wing. The asteroid is thought to be the exposed core of a shattered protoplanet, and there's a plan to visit it in 2026. (Mission tagline: "Journey to a Metal World")
- <span class="catsym">17 Thetis <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: Sea nymph, mother of Achilles
- <span class="catsym">18 Melpomene <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: Muse of the Chorus and Tregedy.
- <span class="catsym">19 Fortuna <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: God of fate and fortune. She is commonly said to be blind. Had a fancy wheel which was later adapted into a popular game show.
- <span class="catsym">20 Massalia</span>: Named after a city.
- <span class="catsym">21 Lutetia</span>: Named after a city. One of the densest asteroids.
- <span class="catsym">22 Kalliope</span>: Muse of epic poetry. Chief of the Muses. Turned some uppity mortals into songbirds.
- <span class="catsym">23 Thalia</span>: Muse of comedy.
- <span class="catsym">24 Themis</span>: Titan of divine law. Second wife of Jupiter.
- <span class="catsym">25 Phocaea</span>: Named after a city.
- <span class="catsym">26 Proserpina <span class="catPUA"></span>⯘</span>: Daughter of Ceres. Stuck in the underworld each winter because Pluto kidnapped her and fed her those underworldly pomegranite seeds. Also a god of springtime, wine, and a terrifying Queen of the underworld.
- <span class="catsym">28 Bellona <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: Wife of Mars. Also a god of a crazed bloodthirsty war. Likes to ride into battle with her hubby and has a special talent when it comes to destroying entire cities.
- <span class="catsym">29 Amphitrite <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: Neptune's wife. God of the sea and salt water.
- <span class="catsym">30 Urania</span>: Muse of astronomy.
- <span class="catsym">31 Euphrosyne</span>: God of good cheer. 
- <span class="catsym">32 Pomona</span>: Wood nymph. God of orchards.
- <span class="catsym">33 Polyhymnia</span>: Muse of sacred poetry and pantomime.
- <span class="catsym">34 Circe</span>: Wizard Queen. Transmogrified people into animals. Daughter of the Sun.
- <span class="catsym">35 Leukothea <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: A nymph or queen who leapt into the sea. The symbol is an old-timey lighthouse.
- <span class="catsym">37 Fides <span class="catPUA"></span></span>: God of trust and reliability. Astronomers pretty much completely gave up on the asteroid symbols past this point.
- <span class="catsym">38 Leda</span>: Spartan queen. Made love to swan-Jupiter, and gave birth to an egg from which hatched Helen of Troy, and the twins Castor and Pollux.
- ...
- <span class="catsym">243 Ida</span>: A nymph who nursed Jupiter. Also the name of the mountain where baby Jupiter was hidden away. The asteroid was the first discovered to have its own tiny asteroid moon. The moon is named "Dactyl", after a group of weird little forge fellas that lived on Mount Ida and protected Jupiter. 
- <span class="catsym">253 Mathilde</span>: Named after an Astronomer's wife. The asteroid was visited by a probe on its way to 433 Eros, and scientists were surprised to see that 253 Mathilde is a loosely packed pile of rubble, more crater than stone.
- <span class="catsym">433 Eros</span>: Aka Cupid. God of erotic desire. Had a romance with Psyche. This asteroid was the first near-earth asteroid to be discovered. It was also the first asteroid people put an orbiter around, and the first asteroid to be landed on. Rich in precious metals. About as big as the asteroid that wiped out the dinos, and has high odds of slamming into the earth in the very distant future.
- <span class="catsym">624 Hektor</span>: A mythological Trojan Prince. The largest of the Jupiter Trojans, which are similar to asteroids, but orbiting in Jupiter's Lagrange points. It's extremely elongated, and has a little moon name Skamandrios, after the mythological Hektor's son.
- <span class="catsym">704 Interamnia</span>: Named after a city. 5th largest asteroid but poorly studied.
- <span class="catsym">1862 Apollo</span>: God of the sun, fortune telling, and all sorts of stuff. This asteroid was the first discovered example and namesake of the Apollo-class asteroids, asteroids whose orbits cross Earth's. (If you remember the meteor that hit Russia back in 2013, that came from an Apollo-class object.)
- <span class="catsym">2060 Chiron ⚷</span>: The wisest of the centaurs. Trainer of heroes. Inventor of botany. The object Chiron was the first recognized example of the astronomical centaurs, a group of objects like asteroids but which orbit further out between the gas giants. They're so named because they seem to resemble a combination of asteroid and comet.
- <span class="catsym">3200 Phaethon</span>: Son of Helios, the sun god. Took his dad's sun chariot for a joy ride, almost destroyed the world, and had to be struck down with a lightning bolt by Jupiter. This Apollo-class asteroid is so named because it flies closer to the sun than any other asteroid.
- <span class="catsym">10199 Chariklo</span>: A nymph, wife to the centaur Chiron. This object is the largest (yet found as of 2019) of the astronomical centaurs, and the smallest object known to have rings.
- <span class="catsym">25143 Itokawa</span>: Named for the father of Japanese rocketry. Rubble pile shaped like a lumpy sea otter. This was the first asteroid from which a sample was collected and brought back to Earth. It's  also the smallest asteroid ever visited.
- <span class="catsym">65803 Didymos</span>: The name is Greek for "twin". It has a moonlet called "Dimorphos", meaning "Two forms." NASA's DART mission is planning to test our planetary defense capabilities by ramming into Dimorphos as high speed in 2022. 
- <span class="catsym">99942 Apophis</span>: A primordial serpent who sought to devour the sun. When this asteroid was first discovered, measurements suggested there was a small chance it would impact the Earth. That's since been ruled out, but it will pass by incredibly close in 2029.



<!--2005 VX3: Highly eccentric. Possibly a dormant comet.
2019 OK-->



## Other Whatsits

- <span class="catsym">ʻOumuamua</span>: The first known instellar object to visit the Solar System. It's name means something like "scout". Probably not aliens, but for a while there, that wasn't a completely ludicrous hypothesis.

Here is a quadratically scaled solar system.
I'm playing around with the symbols for some of the moons.
