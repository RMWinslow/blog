There are a few very common chemicals with similar chemical formulas.
Water is H20, dihydrogen monoxide. It's an oxygen atom connected to two hydrogen atoms.
Carbon dioxide CO2, which is vital for life on earth, is likewise a carbon atom connected to two oxygen atoms.
And the primary component of sand and glass is silicon dioxide, silica, a silicon atom  connected to two oxygen atoms.[^silicastructure]

[^silicastructure]: Though unlike the other two, silica is found is rarely encountered in fluid form, and more commonly seen as a solid crystal.

What other compounds are in this implied set?
As it turns out, mostly a load of toxic stinking gasses.


### Set 1: Hydrogen Chalcogenides

HOH - Dihydrogen monoxide
: Oxidane, Water

HSH - Dihydrogen monosulfide
: Stinkdamp, sewer gas, nasty stuff. Smells like rotting eggs

HSeH - Dihydrogen selenide
: Extremely toxic gas. Smells like rotting horseradish.

HTeH - Dihydrogen telluride
: Smells like rotting garlic.

HPoH - Dihydrogen polonide
: Unstable and radioactive. Extremely difficult to work with.

HLvH - Dihydrogen livermoride
: Haha. No.


### Set 2a: Carbon Dichalcogenides

OCO - Carbon Dioxide
: aka Fixed Air

SCS - Carbon disulfide
: Used to make cellophane. Also sometimes used as a fumigant

SeCSe - Carbon diselenide
: When first sythesized, its smell ["forced the evacuation of a nearby village"](https://corante.com/things-i-wont-work-with/things-i-wont-work-with-carbon-diselenide/).


### Set 2b: Silicon Dichalcogenides 

OSiO - Silicon dioxide
: Silica (Glass/Sand/Quartz)

SSiS - Silicon disulfide
: It's used to make other chemicals, but I can't find any major applications for the stuff on its own.

SeSiSe - Silicon diselenide
: It's been synthesized and [studied](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0567740882005469), but I can't find any fun facts about it. 

<!--
**Set 2c: Various Other Dichalcogenides**
Germanium disulfide, 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Dichalcogenides
-->

### Set 3: Triple Chalcogens

OOO - Trioxygen
: Ozone. Actually quite useful.

OSO - Sulfur Dioxide
: Pollutant. Sometimes used in winemaking or food preservation.

OSeO - Selenium dioxide
: Smells like horseradish, used as a glass colorant.

SSS - [Trisulfur](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Trisulfur)
: Converts to S8 in Earth conditions, but observed on Io and Venus.

SSeS - [Selenium disulfide](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/24087)
: An antifungal agent [used to treat dandruff](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682258.html). On the WHO list of essential medicines. Brand names include Versel, Selsun, and Exsel.

I can't find any interesting info on Triselenide, etc.


<aside>
Water, CO2, and silica neatly correspond to the classical elements of Water, Air, and Earth. The above list seems to imply that the fourth classical element, instead of fire, should be Therapeutic Dandruff Shampoo.
