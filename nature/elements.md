# Hanzi for the Chemical Elements

Only a few pure chemical elements were known to people in ancient times. 
Then starting in the late 1700s, there was an explosion of chemical discoveries.
These new elements required a bevy of new names, 
and many of these elements were named after people or places involved in their discovery.

Peter van de Krogt has [a wonderful website with details about the origins of each element's English and international names](https://elements.vanderkrogt.net/index.php).

But in the 1800s, when people set out to translate such discoveries for global audiences, they found that translating the names of these new elements into Chinese required additional care.

Some early attempts involved direct transliteration, so that a word like "Magnesium" might be translated as "美合尼西恩" ("Měihéníxīēn"), which is a sequence of five characters which by themselves mean: beautiful, together, female monk, west, and favor. That kind of phonetic pileup might work fine for a proper noun (looking at you, "施瓦辛格"), but it looks silly and confusing when placed alongside svelte classically-known element names like "金" and "汞".

The approach settled on by [Xu Shou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E5%BE%90%E5%A3%BD) and [John Fryer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fryer_(sinologist)) was to choose a singular character for each element. 
In those cases where there wasn't already a widely-used character for an element, the pair invented a new one. 
The vast majority of these invented characters are phono-semantic compounds, meaning that one component of the character indicates that it is a chemical element, 
while the other part of the character gives a hint about the pronunciation of the element's name. 
This approach eventually became the standard one, and has been used as recently as 2017 to coin Chinese terms for newly-synthesized elements.

The semantic radicals used are 石 (stone), 钅or 金 (metal), and 气 (gas). Bromine uses 氵(water), and mercury uses 水 (also water).




Back then, there wasn't a standardized system for transliterating between the latin alphabet and Chinese characters. 
As such, translators had to choose between inventing new characters or fully transliterating elements names via an unwieldy chain of near-homophones (eg using "美合尼西恩" to Měihé ní xī ēn).

Where do element names come from? Here's a cute  little list.
See the links at the end for some more in-depth resources.


The "picto" column below represents a silly sort of literal interpretation of the radicals that make up the hanzi character.[^hanzidecomposition]

[^hanzidecomposition]: The majority of Chinese characters are phono-semantic compounds, meaning that part of the character hints about its meaning, and part hints about its pronunciation. And aside from the few elements known to antiquity, the characters for chemical elements tend to follow this same pattern. Non-metals which are solid at STP use a 石 radical, which by itself means stone/rock/mineral. Gaseous elements use 气 (gas/breath/vapor). Metals use 钅, which is a simplified version of 金, meaning gold or metal in general. The other part of the character is a homophone in Mandarin. For example, the 'oxygen' character (氧) is a combination of gas (气) and goat (羊) because oxygen ('yǎng') is a near-homophone for goat ('yáng'). However, the etymology of the spoken word is more likely related to the word for nourishing support (also 'yǎng', 养).
