# Hanzi for the Chemical Elements

Only a few pure chemical elements were known to people in ancient times. 
Then starting in the late 1700s, there was an explosion of chemical discoveries.
These new elements required a bevy of new names, 
and many of these elements were named after people or places involved in their discovery.

Peter van de Krogt has [a wonderful website with details about the origins of each element's English and international names](https://elements.vanderkrogt.net/index.php).

But in the 1800s, when people set out to translate such discoveries for global audiences, they found that translating the names of these new elements into Chinese required additional care.

Some early attempts involved direct transliteration, so that a word like "Magnesium" might be translated as "美合尼西恩" ("Měihéníxīēn"), which is a sequence of five characters which by themselves mean: beautiful, together, female monk, west, and favor. That kind of phonetic pileup might work fine for a proper noun (looking at you, "施瓦辛格"), but it looks silly and confusing when placed alongside svelte classically-known element names like "金" and "汞".

The approach settled on by [Xu Shou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E5%BE%90%E5%A3%BD) and [John Fryer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fryer_(sinologist)) was to choose a singular character for each element. 
In those cases where there wasn't already a widely-used character for an element, the pair invented a new one. 
The vast majority of these invented characters are phono-semantic compounds, meaning that one component of the character indicates that it is a chemical element, 
while the other part of the character gives a hint about the pronunciation of the element's name. 
This approach eventually became the standard one, and has been used as recently as 2017 to coin Chinese terms for newly-synthesized elements.

The semantic radicals used are 石 (stone), 钅or 金 (metal), and 气 (gas). Bromine uses 氵(water), and mercury uses 水 (also water).




Back then, there wasn't a standardized system for transliterating between the latin alphabet and Chinese characters. 
As such, translators had to choose between inventing new characters or fully transliterating elements names via an unwieldy chain of near-homophones (eg using "美合尼西恩" to Měihé ní xī ēn).

## List of Element Names in Mainland Mandarin Chinese

In the "Radicals" column, I've pasted the sort-of component sub-characters on their own.
In the "Literal" column, I've written a literal translation of these component characters.
But remember that these typically aren't the actual etymology of these words; their homophonic mnemonics in Mandarin.

In some cases, the simplified character isn't available.

antimony? 厗


费 expenditure is 弗 negative 贝 money

[^ancientname]: This element's name has been in use for a very long time, though the modern character may have been changed for the sake of standardization or simplification. 

[^hydrogennote]: "轻" decomposes to "车𢀖". "车" means cart. By itself, "𢀖" doesn't really have any meaning. Another early translation of "hydrogen" into Chinese was "水母气" (shuǐmǔqì), where "水" means 'water' and "母" means 'mother'. It's clear that the translator intended this to be a literal translation of the term (hydro-gen = water-producer), but "水母" means 'jellyfish', so it's a rather awkward translation.

[^oxygennote]: "Oxygen" was initially translated into Chinese as "养气" (yángqì), where "养" means helping something grow. However, the character for oxygen, "氧" (yǎng), actually decomposes to "羊气" (yángqì), where "羊" means 'goat'. This substitution works well on multiple levels - because "yǎng" and "yáng" are near homophones, because "养" appears to contain the character "羊" as a sub-component, and because animal life is dependent on abundant oxygen. The phrase "养气" itself is still in use nowadays, but in a more spiritual sense; "气" (qì) can also refer to the traditional notion of life energy, and so 养气 is basically self-care.

[^nitrogennote]: "Nitrogen" was translated in Chinese as "淡气" (dànqì), where "淡" means 'bland' or 'dilute' and is composed of one 氵water radical  and two 火 fire radicals. Confusingly, the character for nitrogen drops the water radical, making "氮" appear to be composed of "炎气" (yánqì), where 炎 means 'blazing hot' or 'inflammation', neither of which makes sense to describe nitrogen. Another old translation of "Nitrogen" was "硝气" (xiāoqì), where "硝" means 'niter'. Niter is also the source of the word "nitrogen", so "硝气" was a more direct translation. 

[^chlorinenote]: Chlorine uses 录 (lù) (copy) instead of the full 绿 (lǜ) (green)

A NEW INQUIRY INTO THE TRANSLATION OF
CHEMICAL TERMS BY JOHN FRYER AND XU SHOU
http://www.wsc.uni-erlangen.de/pdf/wang.pdf



Ministry of Education and the Institute co-estab-
lished a commission to review chemical terms with Zheng
being the Chief Commissioner. They published the Princi-
ples of Chemical Nomenclature (化學命名原則) in 1933.
Standardized terms.

Among them, masurium (atomic
number 43) and illinium (atomic number 61) were proven to
have been misidentified and then repealed. Only three new
names “鉿” (ha, hafnium), “釙” (po, polonium), “錸” (lai,
rhenium) have been created.

The Revised Principles of Chemical Nomenclature, pub-
lished in 1945, only changed three elements’ names. The
changes include from “ ” to “氡” (dong, radon), from
“ ” to “釓” (ga, gadolinium), and from “鈳” to “鈮” (ni,
niobium)

 On the other hand, we really
had to appreciate Anatole Billequin’s unmatched contribu-
tion to create following 42 names meaningfully: “ ” (alu-
minum), “ ” (antimony), “ ” (arsenic), “ ” (barium),
“鉗” (beryllium), “ ” (bismuth), “ ” (bromine), “ ”
(cadmium), “ ” (cesium), “ ” (calcium), “ ” (cerium),
“ ” (chromium), “錆” (cobalt), “ ” (determined a non-
element afterwards), “ ” (fluorine), “ ” (indium), “ ”
(iodine), “ ” (iridium), “ ” (lanthanum), “鉐” (lithium),
“ ” (magnesium), “ ” (manganese), “ ” (molybde-
num), “ ” (nickel), “ ” (niobium), “ ” (potassium), “
鐚” (osmium), “硄” (phosphorous), “ ” (rhodium), “
” (rubidium), “ ” (ruthenium), ” (selenium), “ ”
(sodium), “ ” (strontium), “ ” (tellurium), “ ” (thal-
lium), “鐳” (thorium, the word “鐳” is now used by radium),
“ ” (titanium), “ ” (tungsten), “ ” (uranium), “
” (zinc), and “ ” (zirconium).

The changes of inert elements’ names can be used to
illustrate the methodological shift of nomenclature from
meaningful to phonic names In the very beginning, the
Educational Association and China Medical Missionary
Association did use inert elements’ literal meanings to create
their Chinese names, for example, "閑" (xian, rested, argon),
"曦" (xi, dawn, helium), " " (gas + first, argon), "氜" (gas
+ sun, helium), " " (gas + secret, krypton), and " " (gas
+ fresh, neon). The names created by the European Branch
of the Chinese Chemical Society were all meaningful, such
as "氜" (gas + sun, helium), " " (krypton), " " (neon)
with only one exception " " (gong, argon
-->








Where do element names come from? Here's a cute  little list.
See the links at the end for some more in-depth resources.


The "picto" column below represents a silly sort of literal interpretation of the radicals that make up the hanzi character.[^hanzidecomposition]

[^hanzidecomposition]: The majority of Chinese characters are phono-semantic compounds, meaning that part of the character hints about its meaning, and part hints about its pronunciation. And aside from the few elements known to antiquity, the characters for chemical elements tend to follow this same pattern. Non-metals which are solid at STP use a 石 radical, which by itself means stone/rock/mineral. Gaseous elements use 气 (gas/breath/vapor). Metals use 钅, which is a simplified version of 金, meaning gold or metal in general. The other part of the character is a homophone in Mandarin. For example, the 'oxygen' character (氧) is a combination of gas (气) and goat (羊) because oxygen ('yǎng') is a near-homophone for goat ('yáng'). However, the etymology of the spoken word is more likely related to the word for nourishing support (also 'yǎng', 养).
