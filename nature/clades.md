# Common-Name Cladistics (or Calling a Whale a Fish)

- An uneducated person might think that whales are fish.  
- An educated person knows that whales aren't fish; they're mammals.  
- A fan of the show *QI* knows that there is [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhwcEvMJz1Y).   
- The enlighted pedant knows that whales *are* fish because *all mammals* are fish.  

So goes the internet discourse. 

Pufferfish, you see, share a more recent ancestor with humans than they do with sharks.
Any group consisting of only the things called '[fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish)' is a group defined by physical features rather than shared ancestry.
Fish, in other words, aren't a true *clade*.

<aside>
 A <b>clade</b> is any group of organisms which share a common ancestor, such that all of the descendants of that common ancestor are included in the group.
</aside>

These kinds of discussions can be somewhat silly, but thinking about the tree of life in terms of 
[clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade) can be a fun and enlightening exercise.
After all, we used to think of reptiles and amphibians as the same kind of thing. 
And it was only in the last century that people realized that mushrooms aren't plants.

So let's run with the fish example. Let's build a cladistic tree of life using common names instead of latin names.
And when a common-name describes a non-clade group, we'll modify our usage of that common name to turn it into a clade.

<!--Insert graphics here. Aside with Lupo's comment about how none of the groupings are wrong per se just useless.-->

## Explanations for Clade Names

### Fishes (Vertebrata)

Fish are not a clade. The common ancestor of sharks, tuna, hagfish, and lungfish, is also the ancestor of tetrapods (reptiles, birds, mammals, and amphibians; all typically four-limbed land creatures). *Vertebra* is the name for the clade which includes tetrapods and fish, and its members are called *vertebrates*. 

Thus fish, as usually defined, is the group consisting of *non-tetrapod vertebrates*. 

To to make "fish" a clade, we must includes whales, chickens, and the like. 

<aside> 
If you wanted to expand the clade to include everything that is sometimes *called* a fish (jellyfish, inkfish, starfish), you would need to include basically every animal excepts sponges.
</aside>


The remaining examples are listed in roughly decreasing order of sensibility:



### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)

Likewise, dinosaurs, as the category exists in the imagination of children and film-makers, are not a clade. It's only once birds are included that the category of *dinosauria* becomes cladistic.
Hence why dinos, as they appear in pop-culture, are called *non-avian dinosaurs* by science educators.

For "dinosaur", the cladistic definition came before the common-name category, so this is the one time in this exercise where no one can object.

<aside markdown="block">
Sidenote: Pterosaurs aren't in the clade of dinosauria, but they're more closely related to dinosaurs than they are to anything else, so I think it's perfectly reasonable to include them in the pop-culture category of dinos. But if you want a more proper name, the clade containing both dinosaurs and pterosaurs is called  *[Panaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avemetatarsalia)*, meaning 'every bird', or *Avemetatarsalia*, meaning 'bird-footbones'. Eugh. Those names are both boring an confusing. I much prefer Ernst Haeckel's suggestion that the clade by called 
[dracones](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Systematische_Phylogenie_Wirbelthiere/ZXxZAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=dracones+Haeckel,+1895&pg=PR17&printsec=frontcover),
which is just latin for 'dragons'. 
</aside>


### Elephants (Elephantidae)

Asian Elephants are more closely related to Mammoths than they are to African Elephants. Mammoths were fuzzy elephants that recently went extinct. This one isn't really controversial. 
(Mastodons were slightly different creatures.)




### Lizards (Squamata)

Lizards are not a clade. Snakes are a clade. So are [amphisbaenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphisbaenia). All three of these types of critters are called *squamates* in the order *squamata*. A lizard is any non-snake, non-amphisbaenian squamate.

This one seems like it might be a reasonable category; snakes and amphisbaenians are both [mostly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GhSOD6CTWA&t=140s) legless, so a lizard is just a squamate that still has its legs, right? Well no, there are loads of legless lizards. As [described by a professional reptile nerd in this amusing rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWPqXlxnki0), there are over twenty lineages of legless lizards, so it seems bizarre that these two in particular are excluded as not being lizardy enough for the lizard club. You know what? His rant is convincing. Snakes *are* lizards, and not just for the purposes of this exercise. *hashtag lizard unity hashtag snakesarelizards*

Conversely, [tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara) look super lizardy, and used to be considered lizards, but aren't part of the squamate clade. Biologists stopped calling them lizards when they noticed that while they do share some traits with lizards, they also share some traits with crocodiles (spiny plates) and turtles (beak instead of teeth). Tuatara are now thought to be the only surviving members of the [beakheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynchocephalia), a sort of sister clade to the lizards. Together, the squamates and beakheads form the clade of *Lepidosaurs*. And for the purposes of this exercise, it doesn't really matter whether we use "lizard" to refer to Squamata or Lepidosauria; both are clades full of lizardy things.



### Rabbits and Hares (Leporidae)

You might not even be aware that rabbits and hares are different things. Cladistically, they really aren't. 
Rabbits usually dig burrows underground, and are born helpless (like us!).
By contrast, hares build nests aboveground and are born ready to run. 

An encyclopedia might define hares cladistically as the genus *lepus* and then define rabbits as the *non-hare leporids*. 
But for this exercise, hares are rabbits. 




### Antelopes (Bovidae)

Antelopes are not a clade<!--, unless we restrict the term to only mean "[True Antelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopinae)"-->. The clade which contains antelopes is called *Bovidae*, and its members are called *bovids*, which means 'cattle-like'. Cows are bovids, of course. So are sheep, goats, and musk ox. An antelope is simply any bovid which people don't care enough about to lump it into its own category.

I suppose you could cheekily define an antelope as any *non-algricultural bovid*. 

"Bovid" is simple enough to be used as a common-name, but for this silly exercise, we're going to call all bovids 'antelopes'.

The clade becomes even more expansive if pronghorns are included. Pronghorns are often called *American Antelope*, but they aren't even bovids; Pronghorn are their own weird thing. The clade which includes both bovids and pronghorns is called *Pecora*, which, like *bovidae*, can be translated as 'cattle-like'. Deer and giraffes are also pecorans. 

So an antelope in the broadest sense is anything related to cattle which isn't similar enough to cattle to be called cattle, but which isn't different enough to be called something else. 🤷

<!--Ancient mythical version of the antelope: saw like horns, used to cut down trees.-->



### Deer (Cervidae)

Deer are a clade if, by 'deer', we mean the cervids, which includes elks and moosen. 
And I can't think of why anyone would object to calling an elk a deer.
So why include this example? 
Because it allows us to segue into the very silly examples.






## Some Certainly Silly Examples 

### Deer (Ruminantia)

Deer are only a clade if, by 'deer', we mean the cervids. 
But there are two non-cervid critters which are also called 'deer'.
The first is the musk deer, which are stinky little fanged fellas more closely related to antelopes than to elk.
The second is the tiny mouse-deer, also called the chevrotain.
Any clade which includes both cervids and chevrotains will include all the ruminants, including our pecoran friends from earlier. 

Remember that deer are ~~pecorans~~ antelopes. Well, antelopes are also ~~ruminants~~ deer. (There's a reason biologists use cumbersome grecolatin names for clades.)

Alternatively, if we wanted to talk about the clade of deer, 
we could instead *shrink* the common-name category and say that chevrotains and musk-deer aren't *actually* deer,
that only cervids are deer.
This is essentially the "No such thing as a fish" approach.

"Amazing antelope" "cross between pig and deer". No. What?
-->


### Shrews (Placentalia)

What's a shrew?
[True shrews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFBp-iNTwBc) are a clade, closely related to hedgehogs.
But there are also [tree shrews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt2ckFI2xwc) and [elephant shrews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvemPyOJZEY).
Tree shrews are now know to be more closely related to primates, and elephants shrews are known to be more closely related to elephants than they are to true shrews (that's not a joke).

The smallest clade that includes all of these shrews is *Placentalia*, encompassing all of the placental mammals - sheep, whales, elephants, you, your dog...

A similar argument could be made to expand 'mole' to apply to all placental mammals, by way of the true moles and the golden moles.
But 'shrew' sounds funnier, and I've heard it said that the shrew's bodyplan is in some sense the 'default' mammalian bodyplan.

(There's also various species called "marsupial shrews" and "shrew possums", which would expand our shrew clade to include all the placental mammals and the marsupials. But unlike the previous shrews mentioned, biologists never grouped marsupial shrews together in the same clade with the other shrews; the pouch makes the difference clear. And besides, there are also creatures called "marsupial mice", "marsupial moles", "marsupial tapirs", and the "Tasmanian tiger". And in Chinese, kangaroos are called "pocket rats". People just weren't being very creative when they named some of these critters.)



### Possums (Marsupalia)

Speaking of marsupials, possums are not a clade. To make possums into a clade, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies, etc.) must be included[^possumcite].

[^possumcite]: From **[An emerging consensus in the evolution, phylogeny, and systematics of marsupials and their fossil relatives (Metatheria)](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/3/802/5498022?login=false)** Beck, Croft, Eldridge, Fox, Travouillon (2019): 
    > A monophyletic grouping of all “possums” (Phalangeroidea + Petauroidea)... was initially supported by DNA hybridization data (Kirsch et al. 1997) ... However, this arrangement has received little support in subsequent molecular studies. Instead these analyses have allied Macropodiformes with either Phalangeroidea (Phillips and Pratt 2008; Meredith et al. 2009a, 2009b, 2009c), consistent with some morphological evidence (Szalay 1994), or with Petauroidea (Meredith et al. 2011; Mitchell et al. 2014; May-Collado et al. 2015), but without strong support for either arrangement.

Possums aren't the same thing as **o**possums (american marsupials famous for playing dead) or shrew-oppossums (a marsupial which is neither a shrew nor an oppossum). But opossums are often called "'possums", and possums were named for their similarity to opossums. Possum.

Anyways, if we want a clade that includes all the (o)possums, then we need to include every marsupial.

: Thus fish, as usually defined, is the group consisting of *non-tetrapod vertebrates*. 

If you wanted to expand the clade to include everything that is sometimes *called* a fish (jellyfish, inkfish, starfish), you would need to include basically every animal excepts sponges.

<!--African lungfish look eerily similar to tetrapods, with their four tendril-like fins which they use to crawl around in the mud.-->

Dinos (Dinosauria)
: Likewise, dinosaurs, as the category exists in the imagination of children and film-makers, are not a clade. It's only once birds are included that the category of *dinosauria* becomes cladistic.

which is just latin for 'dragons'. 


<!--anything closer to a bird than to a crocodile-->


Antelopes (Bovidae)
: Antelopes are not a clade<!--, unless we restrict the term to only mean "[True Antelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopinae)"-->. The clade which contains antelopes is called *Bovidae*, and its members are called *bovids*, which means 'cattle-like'. Cows are bovids, of course. So are sheep, goats, and musk ox. An antelope is simply any bovid which people don't care enough about to lump it into its own category.
: I suppose you could cheekily define antelope as *non-algricultural bovids*, meaning bovid genera which are not commonly tamed and domesticated. 


The clade becomes even more expansive if Pronghorns are included. Pronghorns are often called American Antelope or Pronghorn Antelope. But they aren't even bovids; Pronghorn are their own thing, more closely related to giraffes. The clade which includes both bovids and pronghorns is called *Pecora*, which, like *bovidae*, can be translated as 'cattle-like'. Deer and giraffes are also pecorans. 

So an antelope in the broadest sense is anything related to cattle which isn't similar enough to cattle to be called cattle, but which isn't different enough to be called something else. 🤷

(Along similar lines: a penguin is a dinosaur, and hence a reptile, and hence a fish.)

If you were to partially categorize the vertebrates using only monophyletic groups, 
playing a bit fast and loose with terms,
and avoiding most of the fancy latin terminology, 
you could come up with a tree that looks something like this:


### Clades of Fishes:

- Jawless Fishes: hagfish, lampreys
- Cartilaginous Fishes: sharks, rays
- Bony Fishes
    - Ray-finned Fishes: trout, seahorses, &c.
    - Lobe-finned Fishes:
        - Coelacanths
        - Lungfish
        - **Tetrapods** *(Greek for "Four Legs")*

### Clades of Tetrapods:

- Amphibians
- Mammals:
    - Monotremes: platypuses, echidnas
    - Marsupials: kangaroos, possums, &c.
    - ~~**Placentals**~~ Shrews 
- Reptiles
    - Tuatara
    - Lizards, including snakes.
    - Turtles
    - Crocodilians
    - Birds
        - Ratites, including Tinamous: those weird birds that have trouble with the whole flying concept. You know the ones.
        - Fowl: chickens, ducks)
        - Newbirds (crows, eagles, penguins, all the normal birds)

### Clades of ~~Placentals~~ Shrews:

- Afrotherians *(latin for "African Beasts")*: A grab-bag of animals nobody thought were related, including the elephant, the dugong, the aardvark, and some shrews.
- Armadillos
- Pilosans *(latin for "furries")*: anteaters, sloths
- Supraprimates
    - Lagomorphs (hare, rabbit)
    - Rodents (rat, beaver, capybara)
    - Treeshrews
    - Colugo
    - Primates
- Bats
- Eulipotyphlans ("Truly fat and blind"): Hedgehogs et. al. Shrews here too.
- Ungulates:
    - Odd-toed ungulates: equids, tapirs, rhinos
    - Even-toed ungulates:  
        - Camels
        - Giraffes
        - Pigs
        - Ruminants
        - Whippos  
- Pangolins
- Carnivorans:
    - Caniforms
    - Feliforms
