# Common-Name Cladistics (or Calling a Whale a Fish)

- An uneducated person might think that whales are fish.  
- An educated person knows that whales aren't fish; they're mammals.  
- A fan of the show *QI* knows that there is [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhwcEvMJz1Y).   
- The enlighted pedant knows that whales *are* fish because *all mammals* are fish.  

So goes the internet discourse. 

Pufferfish, you see, share a more recent ancestor with humans than they do with sharks.
Any group consisting of only the things called '[fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish)' is a group defined by physical features rather than shared ancestry.
Fish, in other words, aren't a true *clade*.

<!--TODO: Insert comment about form taxa or folk taxonomy.-->

<aside>
 A <b>clade</b> is any group of organisms which share a common ancestor, such that all of the descendants of that common ancestor are included in the group.
</aside>

These kinds of discussions can be somewhat silly, but thinking about the tree of life in terms of 
[clades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade) can be a fun and enlightening exercise.
<!--
After all, we used to think of reptiles and amphibians as the same kind of thing. 
And it was only in the last century that people realized that mushrooms aren't plants.
-->

So let's run with the fish example. The following is a cladistic tree of life using common names instead of latin names.
When a common-name describes a non-clade group, I'll play a bit fast and loose with that common name to turn it into a clade.

## Explanations for Clade Names

### Fishes (Vertebrata)

Fish are not a clade. The common ancestor of sharks, tuna, hagfish, and lungfish, is also the ancestor of tetrapods (reptiles, birds, mammals, and amphibians; all typically four-limbed land creatures). *Vertebrata* is the name for the clade which includes tetrapods and fish, and its members are called *vertebrates*. 

Thus fish, as usually defined, is the group consisting of *non-tetrapod vertebrates*. 
To make "fish" into a clade, we must include whales, chickens, and the like. 

<aside> 
If you wanted to expand the clade to include everything that is sometimes *called* a fish (jellyfish, inkfish, starfish), you would need to include basically every animal excepts sponges.
</aside>

---

The remaining examples are listed in roughly decreasing order of sensibility:


### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)

Likewise, dinosaurs, as the category exists in the imagination of children and film-makers, are not a clade. It's only once birds are included that the category of *dinosauria* becomes cladistic.
Hence why dinos, as they appear in pop-culture, are called *non-avian dinosaurs* by science educators.

For "dinosaur", the cladistic definition came before the common-name category, so this is the one time in this exercise where biologists can't object.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>What about Pterosaurs?</summary>
Sidenote: Pterosaurs aren't in the clade of dinosauria, but they're more closely related to dinosaurs than they are to anything else, so I think it's perfectly reasonable to include them in the pop-culture category of dinos. But if you want a more proper name, the clade containing both dinosaurs and pterosaurs is called  *[Panaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avemetatarsalia)*, meaning 'every bird', or *Avemetatarsalia*, meaning 'bird-footbones'. Eugh. Those names are both boring and confusing. I much prefer Ernst Haeckel's suggestion that the clade by called 
[dracones](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Systematische_Phylogenie_Wirbelthiere/ZXxZAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=dracones+Haeckel,+1895&pg=PR17&printsec=frontcover),
which is just latin for 'dragons'. 
</details>
<!--anything closer to a bird than to a crocodile-->


### Elephants (Elephantidae)

Asian Elephants are more closely related to Mammoths than they are to African Elephants. Mammoths were fuzzy elephants that recently went extinct. This one shouldn't be controversial. 
(Mastodons were slightly different creatures.)


### Doves (Columbidae)

Columbidae is the clade of pigeons and doves. There is no rigourous distinction between the two terms; I used "doves" in the tree above because it sounds more lovely. The extinct dodo was a large ground-pigeon.


### Lizards (Squamata)

Lizards are not a clade. Snakes are a clade. So are [amphisbaenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphisbaenia). All three of these types of critters are called *squamates* in the order *squamata*. A lizard is any non-snake, non-amphisbaenian squamate.

This one seems like it might be a reasonable category; snakes and amphisbaenians are both [mostly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GhSOD6CTWA&t=140s) legless, so a lizard is just a squamate that still has its legs, right? Well no, there are loads of legless lizards. As [described by a professional reptile nerd in this amusing rant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWPqXlxnki0), there are over twenty lineages of legless lizards, so it seems bizarre that these two in particular are excluded as not being lizardy enough for the lizard club. You know what? His rant is convincing. Snakes *are* lizards, and not just for the purposes of this exercise. *hashtag lizard unity hashtag snakesarelizards*

<!--
Conversely, [tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara) look super lizardy, and used to be considered lizards, but aren't part of the squamate clade. Biologists stopped calling them lizards when they noticed that while they do share some traits with lizards, they also share some traits with crocodiles (spiny plates) and turtles (beak instead of teeth). Tuatara are now thought to be the only surviving members of the [beakheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhynchocephalia), a sort of sister clade to the lizards. Together, the squamates and beakheads form the clade of *Lepidosaurs*. And for the purposes of this exercise, it doesn't really matter whether we use "lizard" to refer to Squamata or Lepidosauria; both are clades full of lizardy things.
-->



### Moths (Lepidoptera)

Butterflies are a clade of moth which tend to be more colorful and come out during the day.
Moths are just non-butterfly lepidopterans. And to make 'moths' into a clade, the butterflies must be included.

Note that the emoji 🐛 represents an ambiguous species. Most emoji sets depict it as a baby moth, but some depict it as a centipede.


### Wasps (Apocrita)

🐝 Bees are a clade. 
🐜 Ants are a clade. 
Wasps are just any of the species related to bees and ants which are neither bees nor ants. 
So cladistically, bees and ants are specific kinds of wasps.
<!--Hymenoptera, also excluding sawflies? Or sawflies are monophyletically all hymenoptera?-->


### Monkeys (Simiiformes)

A monkey is a *non-ape simian*. There are two different clades of monkeys, and any clade that includes both will also include the apes.
Members of that shared clade are called "anthropoids" or "simians".
But for this exercise, I'm calling apes "Monkeys" for the same reason that I'm calling them "Fish".




### Bugs (Arthropoda)

A bug expert might insist that "bug" refers only to a specific clade of insects,
either [hemiptera](https://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/true-bugs) or [heteroptera](https://www.britannica.com/animal/heteropteran), depending on who you ask.
But we all know what a bug is.
It's a creepy crawly little whatzit with too many skittery legs. It's near synonymous with "arthropod".

<!--
Let me check to make sure I'm not the only one who feels this way about the word bug. 
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bug) lists spiders and beetles as examples of bugs.

Even the "Bug" emoji 🐛 doesn't depict a "true bug"
https://emojipedia.org/bug/
-->




### Antelopes (Bovidae)

Antelopes are not a clade<!--, unless we restrict the term to only mean "[True Antelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilopinae)"-->. The clade which contains antelopes is called *Bovidae*, and its members are called *bovids*, which means 'cattle-like'. Cows are bovids, of course. So are sheep, goats, and musk ox. An antelope is simply any bovid which people don't care enough about to lump it into its own category.

I suppose you could cheekily define an antelope as any *non-algricultural bovid*. 

"Bovid" is simple enough to be used as a common-name, but for this silly exercise, we're going to call all bovids 'antelopes'.

The clade would become even more expansive if pronghorns were included. Pronghorns are often called *American Antelope*, but they aren't even bovids; Pronghorn are their own weird thing. The clade which includes both bovids and pronghorns is called *Pecora*, which, like *bovidae*, can be translated as 'cattle-like'. Deer and giraffes are also pecorans. 

<aside markdown="block">
In the emoji tree above, I've decided to limit "antelope" to mean "bovid". "Ruminant" seems like a common term to me.  <!--, with its own relateed idioms Secondly, there are *a lot* of ruminant emojis, and I don't want the row to be so wide that it messes up formatting on mobile.-->
</aside>

So an antelope in the broadest sense is anything related to cattle which isn't similar enough to cattle to be called cattle, but which isn't different enough to be called something else. 🤷

<!--Ancient mythical version of the antelope: saw like horns, used to cut down trees.-->

### Shrimps (Pancrustacea) and Prawns (Decapoda)

Shrimps are not a clade. A shrimp is basically any little crustacean that swims about and looks... er... shrimpy. 
There are many different groups of creature called "shrimp"  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp#Non-decapods](scattered all over the crustacean family tree). 
To turn "shrimp" into a clade, you could either declare one and only one of these groups to be [True Shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caridea), and insist all the others are imposters. 
Or you could shrug your shoulders as I'm doing here and say "sure, all crustaceans are shrimps". 
Lobster? Big shrimp, so big he has trouble swimming.
Crab? That's a big shrimp who folded up his tail.

An additional complication is that scientists have recently learned that *insects* are crustaceans, cladistically speaking. 
For example, the brine shrimp (called Sea-monkeys when sold as pets) are more closely related to butterflies than they are to lobsters.[^seamonkeycite] 
So in this exercise, insects are crustaceans, and crustaceans are all shrimps, so insects are shrimps.

Meanwhile, the 'classic' crustaceans are in the clade *Malacostraca*, which means 'soft-shell' in Greek. 
Aristotle gave them this name because their shells crush under pressure, in constrast to harder-shelled animals (like snails and oysters) whose shells shatter under pressure [^aristotlecite]. 
The most familiar Malacostracans - 🦀🦞🦐 crabs, lobsters, and the other big shrimps people like to eat - are Decapods, in the clade *Decapoda*, meaning 'ten-feet'.  
Malacostraca includes the decapods as well as other creatures like mantis shrimp and roly-polies (isopods).

<!--Krill are not decapods though, and my wife likes to snack on those.-->

I wanted to find a common-name which cladistically includes all of the decapods, and settled on "Prawns".
Like "shrimp", "prawn" has no precise scientific meaning. 
A critter is prawn if it looks like a prawn, and whether a critter is called a "prawn" or a "shrimp" often comes down to regional slang [^weaselprawncite].
But unlike "shrimp", the application of the name "prawn" seems limited to decapods.

<!--MW dict lists two true shrimps as prawns
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prawn
-->

<!--TODO: Example about the "True X" phenonomenon in animal names.-->

[^seamonkeycite]: [A Phylogenomic Solution to the Origin of Insects by Resolving Crustacean-Hexapod Relationships](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217305766) Combosch Giribet Nelson Schwentner (2017). (Sea-monkeys are a kind of Branchiopoda). This paper says something called Remipedia are even closer to insects, but I've never even heard of Remipedes before.

[^aristotlecite]: From [a translated copy](https://archive.org/details/historiaanimaliu00aris_0) of Aristotle's History of Animals
    > Another  genus  is  that  of  the  malacostraca.  These  are animals  that  have  their  hard  structure  outside,  and  their soft  or  flesh-like  substance  inside,  and  the  hard  substance belonging  to  them  has  to  be  crushed  rather  than  shattered; and  to  this  genus  belongs  the  crawfish  and  the  crab. 

[^weaselprawncite]: Several examples of such regional differences are given on page 108 of [This is Not a Weasel](https://archive.org/details/thisisnotweasel00phil/page/108/mode/2up), by Philip B Mortenson.

<!--
A lobster is a bulked up shrimp that crawls more than it swims. A crab is a lobster with its tail curled up underneath it, though [many of those crabs aren't actually crabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx3ELI5A8GE).
-->




### Worms (Bilateria)

Between the segmented worms, the round worms, the arrow worms, the flat worms, the velvet worms, the various arthropods called 'worms' (eg silkworms), and the snakes [from whence the word originates via "wyrm"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/worm), worms cover most of the animal family tree. 
Nearly all animals, excepting a few simple creatures like jellies and sponges, are bilaterally symmetric creatures with body plans built around a central tube - they're worms, cladistically and structurally.

<!--Non-snake cylidrical bilaterians?-->



### Birds of Prey (Telluraves)

Birds of Prey, (aka "Raptors", though *Jurassic Park* has completely changed the meaning of that term,) are the big fierce hunter birds.
Eagles, hawks, falcons -- you know the lot.
It was a sensible guess that these birds might be a clade, but it is now known that falcons are more closely related to parrots and songbirds.
The clade containing all the birds of prey is now called "Telluraves", which means "Earth-birds".
Owls and woodpeckers are also telluravians.

The 🐦 emoji is displayed as different species depending on the emoji set, but all of the identifiable species (bluebird, cardinal, canary, parrot) are telluravians. 



### Shrews (Placentalia)

What's a shrew?
[True shrews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFBp-iNTwBc) are a clade, closely related to hedgehogs.
But there are also [tree shrews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt2ckFI2xwc) and [elephant shrews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvemPyOJZEY).
All three of these creatures were once thought to be closely related, 
but tree shrews are now know to be more closely related to primates, and elephants shrews are known to be more closely related to elephants than they are to true shrews (that's not a joke).

The smallest clade that includes all of these shrews is *Placentalia*, encompassing all of the placental mammals - sheep, whales, elephants, you, your dog...

A similar argument could be made to expand 'mole' to apply to all placental mammals, by way of the true moles and the golden moles.
But 'shrew' sounds funnier, and I've heard it said that the shrew's bodyplan is in some sense the 'default' mammalian bodyplan.

(There's also various species called "marsupial shrews" and "shrew possums", which would expand our shrew clade to include all the placental mammals and the marsupials. But unlike the previous shrews mentioned, biologists never grouped marsupial shrews together in the same clade with the other shrews; the pouch makes the difference clear. And besides, there are also creatures called "marsupial mice", "marsupial moles", "marsupial tapirs", and the "Tasmanian tiger". And in Chinese, kangaroos are called "pocket rats". People just weren't being very creative when they named some of these critters.)



### Possums (Marsupalia)

Speaking of marsupials, possums are not a clade. To make possums into a clade, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies, etc.) must be included[^possumcite].

[^possumcite]: From **[An emerging consensus in the evolution, phylogeny, and systematics of marsupials and their fossil relatives (Metatheria)](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/100/3/802/5498022?login=false)** Beck, Croft, Eldridge, Fox, Travouillon (2019): 
    > A monophyletic grouping of all “possums” (Phalangeroidea + Petauroidea)... was initially supported by DNA hybridization data (Kirsch et al. 1997) ... However, this arrangement has received little support in subsequent molecular studies. Instead these analyses have allied Macropodiformes with either Phalangeroidea (Phillips and Pratt 2008; Meredith et al. 2009a, 2009b, 2009c), consistent with some morphological evidence (Szalay 1994), or with Petauroidea (Meredith et al. 2011; Mitchell et al. 2014; May-Collado et al. 2015), but without strong support for either arrangement.

Possums aren't the same thing as **o**possums (american marsupials famous for playing dead) or shrew-oppossums (a marsupial which is neither a shrew nor an oppossum). But opossums are often called "'possums", and possums were named for their similarity to opossums. Possum.
So for this exercise, I've lumped them together.
The smallest clade that includes all the (o)possums is the clade which includes every marsupial.

## Other Clade Names Used

In some cases, I wasn't able to find a common name which could be expanded to cover a clade, and didn't want to just list each species individually.

### Actual Clade Names

- Arachnids - Everyone's heard of Arachne, right?
- Supraprimates - It rolls off the tongue better than the synonym *Euarchontoglires*, which means soemthing like 'true-rulers-and-dormice'.  
- Even-toed Ungulates
- Odd-toed Ungulates
- Ruminants - "Ruminant" actually has more results on Google than "Ruminate" (66m vs 41m), so it seems like a common enough term.
- Crocodilians - Secret tip: Never worry about whether it's a crocodile or an alligator. Just call them both crocodilians.
- Ratites - This is the term for those weird flightless bird. The name comes from the shape of their sternum. Why isn't there a kiwibird emoji?
- Fowl, Landfowl, Waterfowl
- Rodents
- Camelids

<!--TODO: Give some of these sillier names.-->


### 'Translated' Names

- Dogalikes (Caniformia)
- Newbirds (Neoaves) - It's difficult to determine the relationships between birds within this clade because it underwent very rapid speciation after most of the dinos got wiped out [^neoavescite].
- Tyrants (Tyrannosaurus) - Listing all Theropods would make birds a subset, and I didn't want to indent that sublist an extra time.  


[^neoavescite]: [Data Types and the Phylogeny of Neoaves](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6004/2/1/1/htm). Braun and Kimball (2021).
     This paper compares the different versions of the bird family tree. Studies agree about some parts of the family tree, but disagree about others. (e.g. what's going on with the hoatzins?) The language in this article is very technical, but the pictures give ample context. 




### Other Clade Names

- Stinkers (Musteloidea) - Most of the species in this clade are noted for their use of anal-gland secretions for use in communication and defense. "Badger" would also work as a name for the clade because there is a skunk species called the "stink badger".
- Longnecks (Sauropods) - They've got the longest necks. It's a good name. Thanks to *The Land Before Time* for this one. 
- Whippos (Whippomorpha) - It's not a common term at all, but what a fun word.

<!--
CLADES TYPED OUT BUT EXCLUDED FROM ARTICLE




### Rabbits and Hares (Leporidae)

You might not even be aware that rabbits and hares are different things. Cladistically, they really aren't. 
Rabbits usually dig burrows underground, and are born helpless (like us!).
By contrast, hares build nests aboveground and are born ready to run. It's primarily a distinction based on nesting behavior, not ancestry.
An encyclopedia might define hares cladistically as the genus *lepus* and then define rabbits as the *non-hare leporids*. 
But for this exercise, hares are rabbits. 





### Deer (Cervidae)

Deer are a clade if, by 'deer', we mean the cervids, which includes elks and moosen. 
And I can't think of why anyone would object to calling an elk a deer.
So why include this example? 
Because it allows us to segue into the very silly examples.

### Deer (Ruminantia)

Deer are only a clade if, by 'deer', we mean the cervids. 
But there are two non-cervid critters which are also called 'deer'.
The first is the musk deer, which are stinky little fanged fellas more closely related to antelopes than to elk.
The second is the tiny mouse-deer, also called the chevrotain.
Any clade which includes both cervids and chevrotains will include all the ruminants, including our pecoran friends from earlier. 

Remember that deer are ~~pecorans~~ antelopes. Well, antelopes are also ~~ruminants~~ deer. (There's a reason biologists use cumbersome grecolatin names for clades.)

Alternatively, if we wanted to talk about the clade of deer, 
we could instead *shrink* the common-name category and say that chevrotains and musk-deer aren't *actually* deer,
that only cervids are deer.
This is essentially the "No such thing as a fish" approach.
-->























<!--
(Along similar lines: a penguin is a dinosaur, and hence a reptile, and hence a fish.)

If you were to partially categorize the vertebrates using only monophyletic groups, 
playing a bit fast and loose with terms,
and avoiding most of the fancy latin terminology, 
you could come up with a tree that looks something like this:


### Clades of Fishes:

- Jawless Fishes: hagfish, lampreys
- Cartilaginous Fishes: sharks, rays
- Bony Fishes
    - Ray-finned Fishes: trout, seahorses, &c.
    - Lobe-finned Fishes:
        - Coelacanths
        - Lungfish
        - **Tetrapods** *(Greek for "Four Legs")*

### Clades of Tetrapods:

- Amphibians
- Mammals:
    - Monotremes: platypuses, echidnas
    - Marsupials: kangaroos, possums, &c.
    - ~~**Placentals**~~ Shrews 
- Reptiles
    - Tuatara
    - Lizards, including snakes.
    - Turtles
    - Crocodilians
