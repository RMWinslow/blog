# What is plastic?

*Plastic* is a word which simply means that something is easy to shape.
When we use the word as a noun, we're usually talking about a specific group of plastic materials made of _man-made polymers_.

Polymers
: The name means "many-parts". Polymers are long chains of simple molecules called *monomers*. Polymer materials are strong and flexible for much the same reason that cloth is strong and flexible. The long chains are tough to snap but can bend and slide past each other.

Monomers
: The name means "one part". These are the pieces that link together to make a polymer. Simple sugar is one of the most common monomers.

Most plastics were developed by attempting to find substitutes for or improvements to their naturally occuring counterparts.

<!--Let's first take a look at the useful properties of naturally-occuring polymers, and then look <!--at some materials humans have invented with similar properties at how humans have invented new materials with some of those same properties.-->

## Naturally occuring polymers

### Plant polymers

Polysaccharide
: The name means "many sugars". These are polymers made by chaining together simple sugars. Although simple sugar monomers taste sweet and are easy to break apart, they become very strong and rigid when hooked together.  Starch, cellulose, and chitin are all examples of polysaccharides. 

Cellulose
: The most common polymer on earth! It's what makes plants rigid, and it's the part of plants we turn into paper. Cotton is cellulose twisted into long strands.  Some animals, like cows, are able to break the cellulose back down into sugar to use as food. The human body can't do that, but we can still use cellulose as dietary fiber (which helps us take regular poops.)

Lignin
: Lignin is a more complicated polymer made by linking together several kinds of monomers. When mixed with cellulose, it increases the hardness and rot resistance of the material. Wood is a mixture of cellulose and lignin.

Latex
: Latex is a sticky substance made of polymers mixed with water. Plants make the stuff to protect themselves from predators.  Humans have figured out how to process some kinds of latex into materials like natural rubber and chicle.


### Bug polymers

Chitin
: A polymer used in the bodies of many animals and fungi. It's made by altering the sugar with nitrogen before linking it together. Chitin is used by insects and crabs to make their exoskeletons, and by fish to make their scales. Many scientists are trying to figure out a way of manufacturing chitin on large scales so that we can mold things out of it. The best we've figured out so far is to grind up shrimp shells and mix them with a bit of lye.

Shellac
:

Silk
: 

There are many other important natural polymers, including natural rubber, shellac, and silk.
And some of the substances in the human body are technically polymers, like protein and DNA.

### The polymers in our body.

Protein 
: Long chains of monomers called *amino acids*. There are 20 different amino acids use by the human body and the order in which they are connected together changes their shape and function. Proteins are used for all sorts of purposes, and only some of them are used as building material. DNA, which stores the information on how to assemble these proteins, is also technically a polymer.

<!--Polynucleotide
: DNA and RNA. Both molecules are long chains of several different monomers called nucleotides. Our cells use the order of these monomers to store and transmit information, such as the order of amino acids used to build proteins.-->

Scleroprotein
: Very long proteins that connect together into sheets or fibers. Due to their structure, these proteins behave the most like what we would typically call "plastic". Important scleroproteins include collagen keratin, Fibrin, and Elastin. 

Collagen
: The most common protein in the human body. It's tough and flexible, and used to make ligaments, tendons, cartilege and blood vessels. When mixed with a mineral called *hydroxyapatite*, it can be used to make bones and teeth. The name means "glue-maker", because we boil it down to make some kinds of glue.

Keratin
: Long coiled protein polymers used to make claws, fingernails, hair, feathers, reptile scales, and tortoise shells, and rhino horns. It's very hard and tough. If a part of your skin is repeatedly subjected to stress, your body will put some keratin in the skin there to form a callus.

Fibrin
: This scleroprotein helps you stop bleeding when you are injured. First it blocks the damaged blood vessel to slow the flow of blood, and then it's use to build a protective scab to cover the wound while its healing.

Elastin
: Kind of like our body's version of rubber. It's what makes our lungs and bladder so stretchy, and its mixed with collagen to help absorb shocks. Our skin contains elastin fibers, and the loss of these causes our skin to get saggy as we age.






## Man-made polymers

### Semi-natural plastics

If we're talking very broadly, bread can be though of as one of the first man-made plastics. When we knead dough, we're encouraging the gluten proteins in the flour to connect together into long cross-connected fibers, which makes the bread flexible and chewy.


Rayon (1894)
: Cloth from wood! Chemically the same as cellulose, but arranged into much more regular fibers, which makes it desirable for use in textiles. [Made by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayon#Manufacture) treating wood pulp with lye and carbon disulfide (originally called "liquid sulfur"). The treated cellulose is then dissolved, and extruded through tiny holes into an acid bath. Because of the similarity between the extruder and a spider's spinnerets, rayon is sometimes called _artificial silk_.


Cellophane (1912)
: The name is a combination of "diaphanous" (thin enough to be transparent) and "cellulose". Made the same way as rayon, but a narrow slit is used instead of a spinneret. Widely used in all sorts of food packaging.

Casein plastic (1897)
: Casein is the protein in milk that's good for your teeth and bones. It can also be used as the monomer to produce polymers like [milk fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galalith) and [galalith (meaning "milk stone")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galalith). These have largely been replaced by newer, cheaper materials, but milk stone is still sometimes used to make buttons for clothes. 

Bakelite (1907)
: 


Xanthan gum (1960s)
: A polysaccharide used to thicken liquids. Used in sauces and yogurt. Gluten-free use xantham gum as an alternative to kneaded gluten. It's also used to thicken non-food  liquids like shampoo or drilling fluid. It's created via fermentation.
