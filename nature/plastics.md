# What is plastic?

*Plastic* is a word which simply means that something is easy to shape.
When we use the word as a noun, we're usually talking about a specific group of plastic materials made of _man-made polymers_.

Polymers
: The name means "many-parts". Polymers are long chains of simple molecules called *monomers*. Polymer materials are strong and flexible for much the same reason that cloth is strong and flexible. The long chains are tough to snap but can bend and slide past each other.

Monomers
: The means "one part". These are the simple pieces that chain together to make a polymer. Simple sugar is one of the most common monomers.


## Naturally occuring polymers

Polysaccharide
: The name means "many sugars". These are polymers made by chaining together simple sugars. Although simple sugar monomers taste sweet and are easy to break apart, they become very strong and rigid when hooked together.  Starch, cellulose, and chitin are all examples of polysaccharides. 

Cellulose
: The most common polymer on earth! It's what makes plants rigid, and it's the part of plants we turn into paper. Cotton is cellulose twisted into long strands.  Some animals, like cows, are able to break the cellulose back down into sugar to use as food. The human body can't do that, but we can still use cellulose as dietary fiber (which helps us take regular poops.)

Chitin
: A polymer used in the bodies of many animals and fungi. It's made by altering the sugar with nitrogen before linking it together. Chitin is used by bugs and crabs to make their shells, and by fish to make their scales. Many scientists are trying to figure out a way of manufacturing chitin on large scales.

Lignin
: Lignin is a more complicated polymer made by linking together several kinds of monomers. When mixed with cellulose, it increases the hardness and rot resistance of the material. Wood is a mixture of cellulose and lignin.

There are many other important natural polymers, including natural rubber, shellac, and silk.
And some of the substances in the human body are polymers, like DNA, or hair.
