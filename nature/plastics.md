# What is plastic?

*Plastic* is a word which simply means that something is easy to shape.
When we use the word as a noun, we're usually talking about a specific group of plastic materials made of _man-made polymers_.

Polymers
: The name means "many-parts". Polymers are long chains of simple molecules called *monomers*. Polymer materials are strong and flexible for much the same reason that cloth is strong and flexible. The long chains are tough to snap but can bend and slide past each other.

Monomers
: The name means "one part". These are the pieces that link together to make a polymer. Simple sugar is one of the most common monomers.

Most plastics were developed by attempting to find substitutes for or improvements to their naturally occuring counterparts.

<!--Let's first take a look at the useful properties of naturally-occuring polymers, and then look <!--at some materials humans have invented with similar properties at how humans have invented new materials with some of those same properties.-->

## Naturally occuring polymers

### Plant polymers

Polysaccharide
: The name means "many sugars". These are polymers made by chaining together simple sugars. Although simple sugar monomers taste sweet and are easy to break apart, they become very strong and rigid when hooked together.  Starch, cellulose, and chitin are all examples of polysaccharides. 

Cellulose
: The most common polymer on earth! It's what makes plants rigid, and it's the part of plants we turn into paper. Cotton is cellulose twisted into long strands.  Some animals, like cows, are able to break the cellulose back down into sugar to use as food. The human body can't do that, but we can still use cellulose as dietary fiber (which helps us take regular poops.)

Lignin
: Lignin is a more complicated polymer made by linking together several kinds of monomers. When mixed with cellulose, it increases the hardness and rot resistance of the material. Wood is a mixture of cellulose and lignin.

Latex
: Latex is a sticky substance made of polymers mixed with water. Plants make the stuff to protect themselves from predators.  Certain kinds of latex can be processed into materials like natural rubber and chicle.


### Bug polymers

Chitin
: A polymer used in the bodies of many animals and fungi. It's made by altering the sugar with nitrogen before linking it together. Chitin is used by insects and crustaceans to make their exoskeletons, and by fish to make their scales. Many scientists are trying to figure out a way of manufacturing chitin on large scales so that we can mold things out of it. The best we've figured out so far is to grind up shrimp shells and mix them with a bit of lye.

Lac
: A substance secreted by certain kinds of insects as protection while they feed on plants. People harvest lac and dissolve it in alchol to form shellac. It can be brushed onto a surface to form a glossy water-resistant coating (and similar synthetic materials are still called lacquers). It can also be molded into complex shapes. Before the invention of vinyl, records were typically made of shellac.

Silk
: This is the stuff spiders use to spin their webs. The spider keeps the liquid containing the silk monomers in its silk glad, and then squeezes the liquid through a twisted narrow passageway  called the spinneret while pulling on the other end. This process causes the components of the silk to connect together into a tough fiber. Many insects, most famously the silk worm, use a similar process to build a shelter out of silk. Natural silk cloth is made by combining the silk from thousands of silk worm coccoons. 


### The polymers in our body.

Protein 
: Long chains of monomers called *amino acids*. There are 20 different amino acids use by the human body and the order in which they are connected together changes their shape and function. Proteins are used for all sorts of purposes, and only some of them are used as building material. DNA, which stores the information on how to assemble these proteins, is also technically a polymer.

<!--Polynucleotide
: DNA and RNA. Both molecules are long chains of several different monomers called nucleotides. Our cells use the order of these monomers to store and transmit information, such as the order of amino acids used to build proteins.-->

Scleroprotein
: Very long proteins that connect together into sheets or fibers. Due to their structure, these proteins behave the most like what we would typically call "plastic". Important scleroproteins include collagen keratin, Fibrin, and Elastin. 

Collagen
: The most common protein in the human body. It's tough and flexible, and used to make ligaments, tendons, cartilege and blood vessels. When mixed with a mineral called *hydroxyapatite*, it can be used to make bones and teeth. The name means "glue-maker", because we can boil it down to make some kinds of glue.

Keratin
: Long coiled protein polymers used to make claws, fingernails, hair, feathers, reptile scales, and tortoise shells, and rhino horns. It's very hard and tough. If a part of your skin is repeatedly subjected to stress, your body will put some keratin in the skin there to form a callus.

Fibrin
: This scleroprotein helps you stop bleeding when you are injured. First it blocks the damaged blood vessel to slow the flow of blood, and then it's use to build a protective scab to cover the wound while its healing.

Elastin
: Kind of like our body's version of rubber. It's what makes our lungs and bladder so stretchy, and its mixed with collagen to help absorb shocks. Our skin contains elastin fibers, and the loss of these causes our skin to get saggy as we age.






## Man-made polymers

If we're talking very broadly, bread can be thought of as one of the first man-made plastics. When we knead dough, we're encouraging the gluten proteins in the flour to connect together into long cross-connected fibers, which makes the bread flexible and chewy.

### Cellulose-based plastics

Nitrocellulose (1846)
: The first man-made plastic. It's made by treating cellulose with a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. (An alchemist would call these "spirit of niter" and "oil of vitriol".) Nitrocellulose was discovered on accident after a chemist used a cotton apron to wipe up an acid spill. Later, his apron dramatically burst into flame when hung up to dry. When used as an explosive, it's called "gun cotton" or "smokeless gunpowder". But it can also be easily dissolved and painted onto a surface as lacquer, replacing shellac. Nail polish is often dissolved nitrocellulose.

<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodion-->

Celluloid (1862/1868)
: A mixture of nitrocellulose with camphor, which is a stinky wax harvested from the camphor laurel. The camphor makes the nitrocellulose stronger and easier to work with. Celluloid is a _thermoplastic_, which means that it can be heated to become soft, molded into shape, and then cooled back down to become hard. Celluloid's first application was as a replacement for the ivory (elephant tooth) previously used to make billiard balls, and soon became widely popular as a replacement for horn and ivory in all sorts of applications. Celluloid film was also the first flexible material which could hold photographs. This flexibility allowed many small photographs to be stored on a long coiled strip of film, and led to the rise of moving pictures as an art form.   
    
Oh, but do remember that this stuff is basically gunpowder. The camphor makes the nitrocellulose significantly *less* explosive, but it's still a *wee bit* explosive. Early celluloid billiard balls would sometimes explode on impact, and the tendency for film to spontaneously burst into flame was a huge problem for the early movie industry. If you have any ping-pong balls from [before 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140211033949/http://www.ittf.com/museum/archivesnewproto/BoD/2012%20BoD%20Minutes%20final.pdf), [make sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Ot1W-yiaE) to keep them away from open flame.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandex

Rayon (1894 - Charles Frederick Cross, Edward John Bevan, Clayton Beadle)
: Cloth from wood! Chemically the same as cellulose, but arranged into much more regular fibers, which makes it great for use in textiles. [Made by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayon#Manufacture) treating wood pulp with lye and carbon disulfide (CS2, originally called "liquid sulfur"). The treated cellulose is then dissolved, and extruded through tiny holes into an acid bath. Because of the similarity between the extruder and a spider's spinnerets, rayon is sometimes called _artificial silk_.

Cellophane (1912)
: The name is a combination of "diaphanous" (thin enough to be transparent) and "cellulose". Made the same way as rayon, but a narrow slit is used instead of a spinneret. Used in food packaging, and other situations where clear, slightly breathable wrapping is desired.

*Because both rayon and cellophane are essentially just smooth, thin bits of cellulose, both materials are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. However, the CS2 used in manufacturing is highly toxic. Also, the word "cellophane" is often used to refer to other sorts of plastic film. For example, when I search for "cellophane" on amazon, the first result (and best seller) is actually made of polypropylene.*

Xanthan gum (1960s)
: A polysaccharide used to thicken liquids. Used in sauces and yogurt. Gluten-free foods use xantham gum as an alternative to kneaded gluten. It's also used to thicken non-food  liquids like shampoo or drilling fluid. It's created via fermentation. 



### Fossil-fuel-based plastics

Phenol-formaldehyde resins (1872 - Adolf von Baeyer, Werner Kleeberg)
: Phenol is one of the earliest chemical antiseptics, and is derived from coal tar. Formaldehyde is made from wood alcohol (methanol), and is used as a medical preservative. When mixed together, they react to form a hard polymer which is difficult to dissolve and can ruin lab equipment.

Early PF resins were difficult to work with and basically useless. But other chemists saw potential in the material, and tried to find improvements.
With the spread of electricity, people needed an insulator to coat electrical wires. The best option at the time was shellac, but the lac bugs couldn't be farmed fast enough to meet this new source of demand. This incentivized Leo Baekeland to experiment with the the stuff

Bakelite (1907 - Leo Baekeland)
: The first modern plastic. Bakelite is made by cooking PF resin at very high pressure. This plastic can be shaped when hot, but doesn't soften when reheated. It's a good electrical insulator, and unlike its alternatives, bakelite is very hard to scratch, burn, or melt. It replaced celluloid for most applications, which was great because bakelite doesn't randomly explode. For the next few decades, everything was being made out of bakelite: electronics, cars, buttons, board games, billiard balls, jewelry. At one point, the US Mint [considered making pennies out of Bakelite](https://uspatterns.stores.yahoo.net/p2073.html).


Ethylene



And from there it gets crazy. Listen, there's like a a bajillion different plastics you can make from ethylene. The stuff is wack.




Ethylene, as it turns out, is an incredibly fascinating molecule. But we can leave that for the next section. For now, it suffices to say that it's a simple, sweet-smelling gas.

So to make the food containers in my cabinets, we need to first make some ethylene and then connect the ethylene into very long chains so that we can injection mold it.

How is it made?
To connect the individual ethylene units into a plastic polymer, chemists use something called a Ziegler–Natta catalyst, which is a metallic compound that guides the reaction of the monomers and helps them to grow into long chains. We don't need fossil fuels for this step.

But where do we get the ethylene? 

The main source of ethylene production is, sure enough, from fossil fuels. You take some crude oil, heat it up with steam, and you're off to the races. The process is called steam-cracking.

But there are non-fossil-fuel sources of the substance as well. In particular, ethanol (the stuff in wine that gets you drunk) is the hydrate of ethylene. To oversimplify, ethanol = ethylene + water, and converting between the two is fairly straightforward. 

So, because we can make ethanol through fermentation, we have a non-fossil fuel pathway to making plastic food containers. And in fact, there are some firms today that manufacture ethylene from sugar-cane derived ethanol, though these make up only a small percentage of global output. There are also commercially available catalytic generators for converting ethanol to ethylene on a small scale.






Sidenote: Ethylene is Kinda Crazy Stuff:
According to Essential Chemistry Online, it's one of the most widely manufactured chemicals on earth, and possibly the most widely manufactured organic molecule by tonnage. (Glucose and its derivatives beats it out in terms of production, but that's grown instead of manufactured for the most part.) This is because it's not just the building block for polyethylene, but also as the precursor for all sorts of other compounds, including the vinyl use to make records.

It's also a very important plant hormone that triggers aging. It's what causes flowers to develop and fruit to ripen. It's also what causes leaves to fall from trees. My wife is very particular in how she stores her fruit, claiming for example that putting apples next to the kiwis will make the kiwis taste sweeter. Turns out, that's not just a weird tradition from her grandma; apples offgas ethylene! Small scale ethylene production is often used for this purpose, generating ethylene gas in an enclosed shed to rapidly ripen fruits. 

Old-timey kerosene lamps produce small amounts of ethylene in their smoke, leading to a bizarre phenomenon in the late 1800s and early 1900s where street lights were killing the trees along city streets.

Oh yeah, and it's also psychoactive. It smells sweet and induces euphoria when inhaled, so was tried for a time as an anesthetic alternative to chloroform. It's also highly explosive in high concentrations, so doctors stopped using it that way as soon as better alternatives were found. There's also speculation that the prophetic visions of the Oracle of Delphi were triggered by ethylene inhalation.

John Collier - Priestess of Delphi - 1891		







Plausible Invention - Would the stuff have been invented without fossil fuels?
It stands to reason, however, that physical possibility is necessary but insufficient for a technology to arise. Physics and chemistry today are exactly the same as they were when the first human was born in the distant past. Yet it took tens of thousands of years to come up with the storage containers to hold my leftover lasagna. 

Let's take a look at how these chemical processes were actually discovered.

Quote textbook about corn production
Until about 1950, ethylene was expensive and was obtained from fermentation ethanol by dehydration – the reverse of the above processes. With the advent of cheap ethylene from steam cracking, the petrochemical route to ethanol became more economical than fermentation. By the early 1970s, scarcely any industrial ethanol was made by fermentation in the United States, although there was a legal requirement in most countries that potable ethanol be made in the traditional way. In the United States in the 1980s, this trend was reversed when government subsidies were introduced to facilitate the production of ethanol by fermentation of corn starch. The product went into automotive fuel known as gasohol. Fermentation ethanol is not economical without subsidies.

### Other monomers

Polystyrene (1839 - Eduard Simon)
: Polystyrene is the 'cheap feeling' plastic used to make packagin foam and disposable forks. The monomer styrene is an oily substance which can be extracted from balsam or cinnamon, though the majority of production nowadays comes from fossil fuels.


PVC


### Ethylene 












Casein plastic (1897)
: Casein is the protein in milk that's good for your teeth and bones. It can also be used as the monomer to produce polymers like [milk fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galalith) and [galalith (meaning "milk stone")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galalith). These have largely been replaced by newer, cheaper materials, but milk stone is still sometimes used to make buttons for clothes.
