Yiru bought herring based fertilizer.

But she was worried about the mercury content.

She found a chart saying that (by Alaskan standards) fertilizer should have no more than 0.05 ppm mercury.

She found a chart of fish mercury content (in micrograms per gram, which I think is equivalent to ppm).
Many fish are above the fertilizer limits, but herring looks fine.
