## 1. Wood magic is about strength and toughness

Wood in your sight can't be bent or broken.
Augment your strength with vines coiled around your limbs.
Form self-repairing wooden plate armour around your body.
Lift and swing massive logs and poles as if they weighed no more than a twig.
Wood you shape and carve has impossible properties. Supernaturally sharp or dense and durable.
MISSING


## 2. Wood magic is about endurance and resistance

Your skin is faintly green. Time spent in the sun makes you rapidly heal.
Become tougher and more immovable the longer your feet are firmly planted on the same piece of ground.
Tap a contiguous piece of wood to render it immovable and inviolable. The effect lasts until you apply it to a different piece of wood.
Repair wounds - yours or another's - with wooden protheses that work as well as flesh.
Go without food or water or rest, and ignore severe injuries as long as you remain in contact with living plant matter
Care for a specific plant. If that plant grows ill, so will you. But as long as that plant flourishes, you cannot be killed.


## 3. Wood magic is about growth.

Sing to plants to make them grow at visible speed.
Snap your fingers to make a sapling instantly, explosively, destructively grow into a full-size tree.
Dense and diverse vegetation sprouts in your footsteps. You have limited control over the kind of plants that grow.
Grow to many times your normal height, with strength scaling more than proportionately. The extra mass sloughs of as leaf litter when you sleep.
Cause dense roots to burst from the ground and ensnare a target, growing around them. Needs existing roots as a starting point.
MISSING


## 4. Wood magic is about weird plant-themed whatsits

Emit soporific spores from flowers blooming from your skin.
Organic material rapids decays under your touch.
Implant a parasitic sprout into someone's body to parasitically siphon away their lifeforce.
Absorb light energy into your skin and concentrate it without bound. Re-release all the light at once.
Rapidly grow parachutes of cottony fibers.
Exude sticky sap in place of sweat.


## 5. Wood Magic is about being in tune with nature.

Step into a tree-trunk, and step out from any trunk connected to the same [wood web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network).
Meditate in a grove to gain tactile awareness of all the creatures therein.
Speak to trees. Learn the strange things they've seen and heard.
Plants and undergrowth don't hinder your passage. They bend out of your way while reaching to tangle those who pursue you.
Trees grow and slowly twist into shapes convenient for you. Chairs, spears, houses, etc.
In exchange for tender care, Trees will relocate at your command. You need to shout; they're hard of hearing.


## 6. Wood Magic is about hurting people... with wood.

Shoot seeds as projectiles from out of your palms. 
Cause impaling thorns to burst from nearby wood.
Summon and swing whip-like vines.
Bring to life mannequins and totems which you carve from wood. They'll follow your commands, and are better at brute force than fine manipulation.
Staffs and polearms can grow and shrink in your hands.
Wield razor-sharp and impossibly rigid leaf blades. 






















ers are resistant to poison and illness.

Here is some visual inspiration: 1, 2.



Bonus: 6 more weird elemental powers to combine with Kangaroo's lists to make a nice round 200:

    The element of Glass: Glass shards cannot cut you, and in your hands they can cut through anything.
    The element of Osmium: You can telekinetically move osmium with your mind. It's quite strong, and has impressive range, but only works on highly purified osmium (which happens to be the rarest of the precious metals).
    The element of Friendship: You can fire concussive beams of force from your palms that, in addition to knocking people off their feet and breaking their bones, also overwhelms them with an intense longing for companionship.
    The element of Flesh: Sprout nasty flailing tentacles.
    The element of Surprise: It's a gun. The surprise is that you can somehow own a working firearm in a magical psuedomedieval fantasy world.
    The element of Aether: Everyone agrees you have a potent elemental power but nobody can quite prove it. 






Reactively form shields of wood.


Wood you carve and wield has impossible properties. Supernaturally sharp or dense and durable.

The element of Aether: Everyone agrees you have a potent elemental power but for some reason nobody can quite prove what it does.

Transfer blows you take to nearby trees. Only one attack deflected per tree.


Cause dense roots to burst from the ground and ensnare a target.
