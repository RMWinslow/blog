Basic Concept:
- It's the solar system!
- But each planet is a gigantic island
- and space is a flat sea of ichor
- and the planets are themed around the mythological associations of their namesakes.
    - Lots of loose word association.
    - Not trying to be authentic to the original myths.
- Each planetary archipelego has some unique magic that only works there
- Each planet also has some unique sapient species
