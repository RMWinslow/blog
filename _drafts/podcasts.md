The following is an email I sent July 2017. Needs cleanup.

Podcasts I really like:

50 Things That Made the Modern Economy: Spotlights on some of history's most influential inventions. Things like the shipping container, insurance, and concrete.

History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps: A philosophy professor summarizes European philosophy. Unlike a college course, which would study in depth a few works, this tries to briefly summarize everything. I'm on episode 70 and thinking about starting over so I can take notes on some interesting or useful ideas. For example, the ancients atomists were multiverse theorists!

Planet Money: Not about Finance! It's about, well, anything related to money really. A few recent topics: 
-A group of russians who managed to cheat casinos by exploiting predictability in the RNG of a certain model of slot machine; 
-The question of whether the government can deny trademark to 'offensive' brands (brought to the supreme court case when an asian-american band was denied the trademark "The Slants")
-Ever heard of 'made-up' sounding holidays like National French Fry day or Talk Like a Pirate Day? Who the heck is making up these things?!

Relatively Prime: "Stories from the mathematical domain". Honestly, the editing can be a bit amatuerish, but the subject matter is really cool.

Surprisingly Awesome: One Host tries to convince other people that something boring like mold is actually really interesting.

Special Category - Anything by Griffin McElroy.
This guy puts out so much content. It's all comedic in nature. I love it, but if you don't find yourself entertained by one of these, I doubt you'll like any of the others.
-MBMBAM: Griffin and his two brothers hosting an advice podcast. Rarely give useful advice. Now also a TV show.
-CoolGamesInc: Griffin and his coworker brainstorm video game ideas. All of them horrible.
-The Adventure Zone: Grifin plays D&D with his brothers and his dad.
-Til Death Do us Blart: An annual review of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

But the first piece of Griffin McElroy content I suggest looking up is a video series called "Griffin's Amiibo Corner".

Podcasts I like but not extraordinarily so:

Hello Internet: CGPGrey and the Numberphile guy chatting about stuff.

No Such Thing as a Fish: Ever heard of the show QI? It's a a quiz show with British comedians. This podcast doesn't feature any comedians. Instead, it features QI's research team. Basically some nerdy folk entertaining each other with interesting bits of trivia.

The Shut Up and Sit Down Podcastle: Shut Up & Sit Down are the best board game reviewers around. Their podcast about boardgames is okay too. You probably would find it boring given that you don't have an extensive boardgame collection.

The Allusionist: A podcast about words. Variable quality. I found some epsiodes really boring but others really interesting. 

Welcome To Nightvale: Surreal broadcast from the fictional town of nightvale.

99% invisible: I discovered this through his flag-design talk. A podcast about design. Well made, but I think this topic matter really works better in a visual medium. 

The Dollop: Two comedians talk about weird bits of American History. The gimmick is that one of them is reading a story that their writing team put together, and the other has no idea what the topic is, which can lead to some great moments of realization. Alas, they're both kind of idiots, so if they're talking about anything that takes nuance to understand, listening to them bungle through the story is super frustrating.

Podcasts that seem tentatively interesting but I haven't listened to very many episodes:

Econ Talk: Seems less entertaining but potentialy more informative than Planet Money. Of the three episodes I listened to, the two featuring guests were very educational. The one where the host read a poem he wrote was...  less so.

A history of the world in 100 objects: A BBC podcast that explores history by describing 100 artefacts from human history. interesting stuff but the host is a bit dull. Maybe good for falling asleep.

Hi-Phi Nation: Philosophy stuff. I think I came across this from a slatestarcodex ad? Only listened to one episode so far. 

BBC's In Out Time: About a variety of topics. I listened to the episode about enzymes. Seemed good.

Anti-recommendations: Podcasts I disliked so much I deleted them from my podcast manager.

Harmontown: Dan Harmon makes amazing television, but obnoxious podcasts. I vaguely remember him yelling something incoherent about "neoliberals" and the audience cheering. 

My Favorite Murder: It's a podcast about murders. It's often highly recommended on reddit, and I thought it would be about criminology or forensics or something. The first episode I randomly decided to listen to featured 15 minutes of the two hosts drunkenly talking about their day. They really should have edited that out. So I switched to a different episode, which was more professionally done. But it was just a lurid story about an actual gruesome murder. Not educational at all. Just gross and scary.

(And then there are also a bunch of podcasts saved to my podcast manager which I haven't listened too, and podcasts which I liked enough not to delete but not enough to recommend. Talking about these wouldn't be more informative than just telling you to look up recommendations online.)
