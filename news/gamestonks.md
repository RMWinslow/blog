This is a really simplified explanation of the current events surrounding the price of Gamestop stocks.

## Key concepts

### Stocks and stock prices

A stock is a tiny percentage ownership of a company. If you own all the stocks of a business, you own that business. Owning stocks often lets you vote on decisions the company makes, and entitles you to a share of the company's profits.

A high stock price does not necessarily mean that a company is doing well. It's simply a reflection of the supply and demand of people buying and selling that company's stock. But if a company is doing well or expected to do well, more people will want to own that company, which makes the stock price go up. As such, stock prices are a useful indicator of the health of a company or the economy, even though they aren't a direct measurement of such.

### How are stock markets useful?

Stock markets serve a number of useful purposes:

- **Stocks can help a business expand.** In an *Initial Public Offering*, a privately owned business is divied up and sold to the public, and that money can then be used by the business to buy new capital, hire new workers, etc.
- **Stock ownership can alleviate risk through diversification.** For example, if I own a restaurant, and the food services industry has troubles, then I'm in for a world of hurt. But if I also own part of a computer company and part of a pet food company and part of..., then I'll be financially okay even if my restaurant goes out of business. Many people place their retirement savings in index funds which are combinations of many hundreds of different businesses.
- **Stock prices can also collect information.** In healthy markets, the price reflects people's beliefs, and also gives a financial incentive for people to share their beliefs. This makes stocks useful in judging the health of industries. This information-gathering ability is sometimes called the *Efficient Markets Hypothesis*. (Note that the term "efficient" used here is not the same as "Pareto Efficiency", used in economics.)



### Being Short

If you own stock in a company, then you'll be wealthier if the price of the stock then goes up. In some sense, buying stock is making a bet that the company will do better than expected.

Short-selling is the opposite. It's any arrangement  where you'll benefit if the stock price *goes down*. It's a bet that the company will do worse than other people expect. Under normal circumstances, short-selling can contribute to the stock market's purposes of mitigating risk and collecting information.

Short-sellers are often blamed for crashing the price of an asset, but this is usually just a case of shooting the messenger.  [According to this article from the the Federal Reserve](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf), a temporary ban on short-selling in 2008 didn't prevent stock prices from falling; instead it just increased transaction costs.

 It also provides an incentive to uncover fraud.

Short-selling can be done is several different ways.
