# ISCC-NBS Color Table

The following colors are based on the ISCC-NBS color system, which

## Motivation and explanation

Colors are hard. 
Some colors we see can't be shown on a screen. 
Some colors on a screen can't be printed. 
RGB values don't cleanly map to human perception because our eyes are most sensitive to green light.

While looking up visualizations of [XKCD's color survey data](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/),
I found this [site](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/),
which contains comparisons of several color name dictionaries.

According to the author, most online color dictionaries don't evenly cover the range of human perception, and include a number of colors which can't be reproduced in print.
They provide several alternate color dictionaries limited to the print gamut, including a cleaned-up version of the ISCC-NBS system with html-style color codes.

I was intrigued by the system, but unsatisfied with it's presentation.
- [This Catalog](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/nbs-iscc.pdf) organizes colors nicely, but in pdf form.
- These text files clearly are easy to access and copypaste from, but 
and a [linked comparison table](https://web.archive.org/web/20121103030619/http://tx4.us/nbs-iscc.htm) presents things in list order.
