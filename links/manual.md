Deep Truth: 
If you come across a hideous bare-bones website, 
where it's very clear that the html source code was manually typed in a text editor, 
there are two possibilities: 
The first is that you you are looking at the ravings of a madman.  
The second is that you are looking at the website of someone really passionate and knowledgeable about a specific subject, like a professor.
In either case, you have found one of the best websites on the internet.

For the sake of this post, 
I shall not label which is which.
The discovery is part of the magic.
