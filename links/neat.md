[H3: Uberâ€™s Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index](https://eng.uber.com/h3/)
: Uber has a clever system for implementing a hex-grid tiling of Earth. There must also be 12 pentagons in the mix, which use the [Dymaxion orientation](https://eng.uber.com/h3/) to place the center of each pentagon in the ocean. [Another link](https://t1nak.github.io/blog/2020/h3intro/). And [here is a python script which generates h3 shapefiles in QGIS](https://github.com/maphew/code/blob/master/gis/qgis/h3-in-qgis.md#preparation).

[USGS Maps Online](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-do-i-find-download-or-order-topographic-maps?qt-news_science_products=3#qt-news_science_products)
: The USGS used to publish paper maps of little snippets of the US. Nowadays, those maps are automatically generated from computerized data. [Here's a map viewer](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/); the GMNA Geological Map is very striking. The USGS also lets you view historical geological survery maps with their "[topoview](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/viewer/)" viewer; just click on an area and historical maps will appear. [Here's a strange location](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/viewer/#15/40.6639/-74.1003), where you can see ship wrecks build up over the decades until they're cleared out, and the bay is turned into a golf course.

[Stalib Datasets](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/)
: A collection of open datasets, as well as links to other resources. (Including the landcover data?) <!--Kaggle looks pretty neat. I need to check it out a bit more.-->

[TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)
: Interactive visualization of an Neural Network as it learns.
