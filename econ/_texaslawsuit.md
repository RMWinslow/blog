[Here's a link to that Texas court opinion about why power generators lack a "duty to continuously supply electricity".](https://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=e4f3ca73-6e48-4a12-8452-bbd1e2d0a816&coa=coa01&DT=Opinion&MediaID=be64e148-f2aa-4bcd-8e2f-82fe8d48b2db) 
The surrounding context is that there's ongoing litigation trying to hold *someone* responsible for the deaths caused by the 2021 TX power outages, and is doing so by throwing every possible claim against the wall to see what sticks.

> Hundreds of retail electricity customers sued hundreds of entities involved in the electricity market in Texas - including natural gas providers, power generators and co-generators (collectively “wholesale power generators”), transmission utilities, public power companies, retail electric providers, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) — for damages sustained due to the loss of electrical power.

**This particular decision only dismisses the negligence claims against wholesale *power generators*.** The grid (by which I mean transmission utilities, ERCOT, etc.) does indeed have have a duty to maintain adequate electrical service to consumers. This duty is legally explicit and confirmed by citations in the opinion. This court opinion essentially just argues that the same duty does not extend to independent power plants. 

I'm not a lawyer, but the court's reasoning seems fairly straightforward, and it also feels commonsensical.

By analogy, if you have a contract with Alice where she promises to bring you bread every day, she has a duty to make sure she can uphold her end of the bargain. But if she fails to do so, you can't then go and sue wheat farmers Bob and Carla. It doesn't *matter* that your hunger would have been prevented if the wheat farmers had invested in a bigger silo. It's Alice's duty to ensure you get your bread, not the farmers'.

This particular decision only dismisses the negligence claims against wholesale **power generators**.

This duty is legally explicit and confirmed by citations in the opinion. This court opinion essentially just argues that the same duty does not extend to independent power plants. 

As mentioned in the court's opinion, "power generators have no actual control over the electricity they produce once it leaves their generation facility", they have no direct relationship with the consumers. This is a consequence of "unbundling", in which 


 and the output from many power plants is going to be intermittent by nature or by design.

I had a simplified picture of the transmission unbundling:

It seems that a lot of the outrage over this court case comes from a conflation of two different kinds of "deregulation" in the TX power grid. The first is that Texas (like many other places) requires that the grid and the power plants be run by different entities. The second is that Texas has its own entirely intrastate power grid which means that the participants in Texas' energy industry are subject to state-level regulation  instead of federal regulation. 
The former issue is the reason for power generators not being liable for the blackouts. The latter issue is a factor in causing the blackouts, but unimportant to the decision that the power plants aren't liable (afaict; ianal).

The grid has a duty to provide reliable power to consumers. This is true even in TX. 
But individual power generators have no such duty, nor are they capable of directly fulfilling such a duty. 
As mentioned in the court's opinion, "power generators have no actual control over the electricity they produce once it leaves their generation facility", and they have no direct relationship with the consumers. They sell wholesale energy to the grid, and the grid provides energy to consumers. Nor is reasonable to expect any particular power plant to always provide continuous power. Power generation is going to be cranked up or down according to need, some sources are intermittent by nature, and each power plant is going to have all sorts of planned and unplanned outages.

In a "[traditionally regulated](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/us-electricity-grid-markets)" wholesale electricity market, your power supplier is typically a vertically integrated monopoly which owns both the grid and the power plants. The 










The first is that power generators aren't allowed to own the distribution and transmission lines. With some exceptions, the grid and power plants are run by separate entities. This isn't unique to TX. Such electricity markets are sometimes referred to as "deregulated" because in a "[traditionally regulated](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/us-electricity-grid-markets)" wholesale electricity market, your power supplier is typically a vertically integrated monopoly which owns both the grid and the power plants. 

*(Even in places with "deregulated" wholesale electricity markets, the power transmitters and distributors are still typically heavily regulated local monopolies. TX is somewhat unusual in that there's also a lot of competition among power distributors, but as far as I know, that quirk of their system didn't contribute to the 2021 blackouts. [It can cause its own issues though.](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-winter-storms-2021/2021/02/21/969912613/after-days-of-mass-outages-some-texas-residents-now-face-huge-electric-bills))*

So the first type of "deregulation" is the reason that power generators are not (can not be) legally responsible, but isn't the direct reason for the inadequate winterization. The second type is the reason that

and could not promise to ensure continuous power.






You can be punished for breaking the law, but the power plants followed regulations. Yes, ERCOT should have had higher winterization requirements, but they didn't.

You can be punished for breaking a promise, but the individual power plants did not promise to ensure continuous power to consumers. Nor could they do so because "power generators have no actual control over the electricity they produce once it leaves their generation facility". It's the grid's responsibility to 



- Power plants "have no actual control over the electricity they produce once it leaves their generation facility"
- 


- Did the power plants fail to follow regulations? No. The negligence claims are instead about the power plants not going above and beyond what was required. Either ERCOT or the TX legislature could have increased winterization requirements, but they didn't do so until after 2021. Should they have? Yes. 
- Did the power plants agree to go above and beyond with winter prep?





The supreme court in First Reserve also importantly emphasized that “[this]
duty is only implicated when the complained-of undertaking is an affirmative
course of action; liability for negligent undertaking cannot be predicated on an
omission.

ERCOT is the one 


ERCOT has authority from

the reliability of the regional electrical network.”

The following facts are not in dispute:

You can be punished for failing to follow regulations. You can be punished for failing to take action to uphold your promises. You can be punished for an affirmative course of action which puts others at risk. But you can't be punished simply for *not* doing something voluntary which you never promised to do and which the law didn't require.

By analogy, if you have a contract with Alice where she promises to bring you bread every day, she has a duty to make sure she can uphold her end of the bargain. But if she fails to do so, you can't then go and sue wheat farmer Bob.

A Texas court dismissed a lawsuit against power generators for damages sustained during the Winter Storm Uri blackouts. [(link to court's opinion)](https://search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=e4f3ca73-6e48-4a12-8452-bbd1e2d0a816&coa=coa01&DT=Opinion&MediaID=be64e148-f2aa-4bcd-8e2f-82fe8d48b2db) 
I've seen some grumblings on social media, but the decision seems not even slightly outrage-worthy to me, and this is a quick attempt to explain why.

### A bit of context

The most important thing to understand is that this court decision only concerns the claims against **power generators** (the firms that operate power plants), not the claims against other parts of the electricity supply industry. 

When you use electricity in your home, it doesn't come from any one particular power plant. Instead, you pay a power distributor to hook you up to "the grid", a vast network of wires which are charged up in sync. The power generators meanwhile work together to keep the grid full of energy. If you have solar panels on your roof, you may be able to sell extra energy back into the grid. In that case, you're a power generator, too. Who's using the electricity you made? Everyone connected to the grid, in a way.

In a "[traditionally regulated](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/us-electricity-grid-markets)" electricity market, your power distributor is typically a vertically integrated monopoly, meaning that they own the power plants as well. In a "deregulated" electricity market, the distributor isn't allowed to own power plants. Those have to be separate firms. (And the company that manages the big high voltage transmission lines has to be separate too.) In a deregulated electricity market, the distributors are still often local monopolies (government utilities and consumer coops are very common for this role), but there are many independent power generators who sell energy to the grid in some sort of publicly managed energy market.


### A bit of context





The court's decision deals with two intertwined questions:

1. Do power generators have a "duty to continuously supply electricity"?
2. Were power generators negligent in failing to adequately prepare for extreme weather?


The answer to question 1 is no, obviously not. They don't have that duty by law, the court can't create that duty, and besides, such a duty would be "essentially unworkable from a practical and statutory standpoint".

2. Were power generators negligent in failing to adequately winterize their stuff?

The answer to question 1 is no, obviously not. They don't have that duty by law, the court can't create that duty, and besides, such a duty would be ~~big dumb~~ "essentially unworkable from a practical and statutory standpoint".

If that last point seems strange to you, remember that we're talking about electricity **generation**, not transmission and distribution. Here, "deregulation" is indeed to blame, but only because a "[traditionally regulated](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/us-electricity-grid-markets)" electricity market is characterized by vertically integrated monopolies where a single entity owns both the grid and the power plants. The *grid* has a duty to provide reliable electricity to consumers, but an individual power plant does not have that duty and could not carry it out. 

By analogy, suppose that there was a utility tasked with delivering food to you. That utility would have a duty to ensure the bread shows up on your doorstep each day, but some arbitrary farmer would not, even if their wheat sometimes contributes to the flour in the bread.




Texas is *far* from the only entity 

This first decision is incredibly obvious and should be 

> In any event, the wholesale power generators cannot produce electricity in a continuous manner but only when electricity is needed. See Luminant, 665 S.W.3d at 170 (noting that “most electricity generation must occur concurrently with consumption”). Moreover, the supply of electricity must be “maintained in near perfect balance at an equilibrium point of 60 Hertz” or the electric grid may fail or cause damage to grid equipment. Id. Accordingly, the new duty that the retail customers assert for wholesale power generators, providing continuous electricity, is essentially unworkable from a practical and statutory standpoint.


The pop reporting I've seen on this do a poor job of explaining the decision, and conflates between two kinds of "deregulation".
