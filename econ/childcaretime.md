We all know that taking care of kids takes a lot of work. But *what kind* of work?

Here, I look at data from the American Time Use Survey.
The following graphs take the time spent on Primary Childcare,[^primaryVsSecondaryChildcare]
and broken it down into 

[^primaryVsSecondaryChildcare]: The BLS uses "Primary Childcare" to refer to time spent where caring for or helping a child is the primary activity. "Secondary Childcare" is time spent watching a child while doing something else, like cooking.

## Data on Childcare Timeuse from ATUS

These averages look at survey responses collected 2005-2019 from respondents who have at least one of their own children below the age of 18 living in their household.

Mothers tend to spend more time on average caring for 
children than do fathers. 

The largest differences are seen in 
physical care (bathing, dressing, feeding, etc.).

Mothers also spend a lot more time on secondary childcare (time spent watching children while doing something else as the primary activity).

On the other hand, fathers and mothers spend similar amounts of time playing with their children.

### Breakdown By Age of Children

Here I slice the graphs by restricting each graph to include parents whose children are all within some specific age range.
