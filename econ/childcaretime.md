We all know that taking care of kids takes a lot of work. But *what kind* of work?

Here, I look at data from the American Time Use Survey.
The following graphs take the time spent on Primary Childcare,[^primaryVsSecondaryChildcare]
and broken it down into 

[^primaryVsSecondaryChildcare]: The BLS uses "Primary Childcare" to refer to time spent where caring for or helping a child is the primary activity. "Secondary Childcare" is time spent watching a child while doing something else, like cooking.



<!--All time with child present? Extra time from cooking when you have kids? Rugrats paper travel time?-->
