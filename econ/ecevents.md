While teaching 3102, 
I've given students the opportunity to earn a few extra credit points
by finding an example of a real-world event
and describing how it is connected to a topic we discussed in class.
Most students just discuss the obvious things: 
the great depression, the 2008 financial crisis, SARS2, etc.
But some students write about things which I haven't heard of,
(and collecting these is secretly the reason I give students this assignment.)

FRED is a good source for the Japanese monetary policy, but doesn't contain the rest of the events you talked about.


Great submission. Very interesting.

I know very little about about the technical details of cryptocurrency, but I personally suspect that for any such currency to become a major part of the economy, it will need to use an implementation with lower transaction costs. Maybe using some alternative to proof-of-work.

My rule of thumb for whether something counts as a medium of exchange is "Can I use it to buy a sandwich?", and given that each transaction costs... 14 dollars?!, Bitcoin doesn't currently cut it.

A further complication when talking about minimum wage in the US is that the federal minimum wage is a floor for state minimum wages, and many individual states have higher price floors on wages.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33831
https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/history

This is especially important if it's true that the optimal minimum wage varies from place to place. (eg maybe $15 per hour is too low for NYC, but too high for a rural town in West Virginia,)



That's quite a dramatic increase in size. Part of it is of course the small denominator (Iceland has less than half a million people.), but looking at the numbers, those are still some pretty substantial banks, operating out of what is essentially a population base the size of Wichita, KS.





I've heard of the problems caused by excessive occupational licensing, but I've never thought about the problems caused by the fact that they're state specific.

Doing a bit more reading about this, it seems like even medical licenses vary by state. But there were efforts in the 90s to make things more uniform and reduce the frictions this caused.



Friedman's views on Chile are interesting. His belief was that a decentralized economy is one of the things that allows a democracy to arise - that economic freedom *causes* political freedom. As such, he argued, working to improve the economy of a authoritarian regime is a fundamentally anti-authoritarian act. I'm not sure that the connection between economic and political freedom is as rock solid as he believed. But it's interesting to think about nonetheless.

Interesting. You can find some graphs of US military spending here: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=53&eid=16400

It's the section labelled "National Defense" and the sub-entries underneath it. Comparing the different components of military spending, they mostly follow the same pattern: a peak in 2009, falling until 2016, and then rising until 2020, where it was roughly equal to the 2009 levels.

There are two exceptions though:
1. Military spending on *software* has been continually rising over that entire period.
2. Military spending on *structures* (buildings etc.) spiked extremely high in 2009, and has bounce back, but not to nearly the same levels as in 2009.

I wonder why the military spent so much on buildings 12 years ago?

(Half point deducted because you didn't fully cite your source.)

It's an interesting topic. I read a paper recently trying to forecast future global population trends. Based on past data, it seems like women's education is indeed one of the most important factors associated with reduced fertility.

I discussed the paper with my wife, and she is very skeptical that China's population will fall as dramatically as the paper predicts. She thinks that Chinese policy will change to allow for more children per couple.
