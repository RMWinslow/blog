~~Counting sheep  / When you're trying to sleep,~~  
Counting Sales / On national scales,
**Being fair  / When there's something to share,**  
Being neat  / When you're folding a sheet,  
That's ~~mathematics!~~ economics!  

When a ball / Bounces off of a wall,  
When you cook / From a recipe book,  
**When you know / How much money you owe,**  
That's ~~mathematics!~~ economics!  


How much gold can you hold in an elephant's ear?  
When it's noon on the moon, then what time is it here?  
If you could count for a year, would you get to infinity,  
Or somewhere in that vicinity?  

When you choose / How much postage to use,  
When you know / What's the chance it will snow,  
**When you bet / And you end up in debt,**  
**Oh try as you may, / You just can't get away**  
From ~~mathematics!~~ economics!  


Andrew Wiles gently smiles,  
Does his thing, and voila!  
Q.E.D., we agree,  
And we all shout hurrah!  
As he confirms what Fermat  
Jotted down in that margin,  
Which could've used some enlargin'.  

Tap your feet,  
Keepin' time to a beat,  
Of a song  
While you're singing along,  
Harmonize  
With the rest of the guys,  
Yes, try as you may,  
**You just can't get away** 
**From ~~mathematics!~~ economics!**
