## Sci Fi and Fantasy

The *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* trilogy, books 1-5, by Douglass Adams
: Well-deserving of its reputation as a comedy classic. Though book 5 felt too meandering to me.

The *Cosmere* series, by Brandon Sanderson.
: Multiple series of loosely connected fantasy novels happening on different worlds in the same magically-rich galaxy. The standalone novel *The Emperor's Soul* is by far the best of the bunch.
