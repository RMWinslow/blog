TODO: intro about Juneteenth

With the Exception of New Years
(Acutally, I could probably spin an argument about that being incorrect too. Some comparison of calenders?)



List of Holidays

- [ ] New Years
- [ ] MLK Jr. Day (Floating)
- [x] President's Day (Floating, never on the right day)
- [ ] Memorial Day (Floating)
- [ ] Juneteenth
- [ ] July 4th 
- [ ] Labor Day (Floating, not on May 1)
- [ ] Columbus Day (Floating)
- [ ] Veterans Day 
- [ ] Thanksgiving (Floating)
- [ ] Christmas (Not actually Jesus' Birthday)



The official name of **President's Day** is **Washington's Birthday**.
George Washington was born on February 22nd,
and the holiday is now celebrate on the third Monday of February,
which occurs between the 15th and 21st of the month.
Thus the holiday never actually falls on Washington's Birthday.

**Martin Luther King Jr. Day** fairs slightly better.
It falls on the third Monday of January,
which *sometimes* coincides with MLK's January 15th birthday.
