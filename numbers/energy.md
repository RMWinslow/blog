# Human Energy Units

## Measuring Your Diet in Watts

We eat food to get energy, which we measure in terms of *dietary Calories*.

We use electricity to provide energy to our homes, which we measure in *kilowatt-hours*.

Physicists often measure energy in *joules*, which is the amount of energy needed to apply a newton of force across one meter of distance.

These different units  of "energy" aren't merely analogous; they're all measuring the same thing. 
It's totally sensible to talk about the Calories burned by your toaster, or
to say that your bowl of pasta contains a kilowatt-hour of energy.



## Energy Conversion Ratios

We can use the following ratios to convert between various measures of energy:

- 1 dietary Calorie (Cal) = 4184 J ≈ 0.001162 kWh 
- 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 3,600,000 J ≈ 860.4 Cal
- 1 metric ton of TNT = 4,184,000,000 J = 1,000,000 Cal[^gramoftnt]

[^gramoftnt]

<!--- 1 joule (J) = -->The energy of explosives is often measured in "(metric) tons of TNT". While the energy actually released by TNT is quite variable, [the *unit* is defined to be](https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811/nist-guide-si-appendix-b-conversion-factors/nist-guide-si-appendix-b8)
equal to 4,184,000,000 joules. This means that a "gram of TNT" is equal to 4184 joules, exactly one dietary Calorie. By contrast, a gram of vegetable oil contains about 9 Cals. (The thing that makes explosives dangerous isn't that they contain a lot of energy; it's that they release that energy very very quickly.)


## Power usage

- A watt (W) is 1 joule per second. 
- The "standard" adult needs 2000 dietary Calories per day.
- There are 86400 seconds in a day.

Combine these conversions to find that 2000 Cal per day is about the same as 97 watts. 

We can conceptualize the power use of appliances in terms of person-equivalents.
