<!--## Measuring Your Diet in Watts-->

We eat food to get energy, which we measure in terms of *dietary Calories*.

We use electricity to provide energy to our homes, which we measure in *kilowatt-hours*.

Physicists often measure energy in *joules*, which is the amount of energy needed to apply a newton of force across one meter of distance.

These different units  of "energy" aren't merely analogous; they're all measuring the same thing. 
It's totally sensible to talk about the Calories burned by your toaster, or
to say that your bowl of pasta contains a kilowatt-hour of energy.



## Energy Conversion

### Ratios

We can use the following ratios to convert between various measures of energy:

- 1 dietary Calorie (Cal) = 4184 J ≈ 0.001162 kWh 
- 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 3,600,000 J ≈ 860.4 Cal
- 1 BTU ≈ 1055 J ≈ 0.252 Cal
- 1 metric ton of TNT = 4,184,000,000 J = 1,000,000 Cal[^gramoftnt]

<!--
Dietary Calories are the energy units listed on a nutrition label.
Kilowatt-hours are the energy units you see on your 
-->

[^gramoftnt]:The energy of explosives is often measured in "(metric) tons of TNT". While the energy actually released by TNT is quite variable, [the *unit* is defined to be](https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811/nist-guide-si-appendix-b-conversion-factors/nist-guide-si-appendix-b8) equal to 4,184,000,000 joules. This means that a "gram of TNT" is equal to 4184 joules, exactly one dietary Calorie. By contrast, a gram of vegetable oil contains about 9 Cals. (The thing that makes explosives dangerous isn't that they contain a lot of energy; it's that they release that energy very very quickly.)



### Energy Comparisons

First of all, how expensive would your food bill be if you could eat electricity?

The "standard" adult needs 2000 dietary Calories per day,[^dailyCalories]
which converts to about 2.3 kWh (or 8.4 megajoules or 7900 BTU).
Let's call this amount a "**Day of Food Energy**" or **DoFE** for short.

<!--TODO: Maybe megacalorie is the better unit??-->

At 16 cents per kWh[^electricityPrice],
electricity costs only 37 cents per DoFE.
Pretty cheap!
Michael Phelps, in 2008, claimed to eat a whopping 10,000 dietary Calories per day,
which would still be less than two dollars worth of electricity.
Alas, man cannot live on voltage alone.

[^dailyCalories]: Your dietary energy use will vary based on a number of factors. [The USDA has a calculator](https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator). I'm tall and a bit chunky, so my energy needs are closer to 3000 dietary Calories.

[^electricityPrice]: Price varies by market. 16 cents per kWh is the [average cost of residential electricity in the US in February 2023](https://web.archive.org/web/20230519025039/https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a).

<aside markdown="block">
For comparison, a pound of flour costs about 55 cents, 
which works out to about 67 cents per DoFE.[^flourCalc]:
That's about as cheap as food energy gets, 
but that's just the energy. The nutrients and flavor cost a lot more.
</aside>

[^flourCalc]: In February, 2023, [the average price of 1 pound of all purpose white flour in US cities](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000701111) was 55 cents. Looking at the nutrient label on the flour in my cupboard, a pound of such flour contains 1650 dietary Calories. By coincidence, these numbers work out to exactly 3000 dietary Calories per dollar, or 2/3 of a dollar per DoFE


<!--
<aside markdown="block">
For comparison, you can buy a gallon of corn oil online for $12.50,
which works out to about 81 cents per DoFE.[^cornOilCalc]:
That's about as cheap as food energy gets, 
but that's just the energy. The protein, micronutrients, and flavor cost a lot more.
</aside>

[^cornOilCalc]: As of May 20, 2023, [this listing for corn oil on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Brand-Canola-Gallon-Ounces/dp/B07RD8PKLY/) costs \$12.44 per gallon. The nutrient label says the jug contains 30,720 dietary Calories of oil, or 15.36 DoFEs. So 80.99 cents per DoFE.

Peanut butter
https://www.amazon.com/Skippy-Creamy-Peanut-Butter-Pound/dp/B00LPE5EZQ/
8.57 for 13490 = 1.27 per DoFE

Sugar
https://www.amazon.com/DOMINO-FOODS-Sugar-Granulated-10/dp/B00O60NVJC/
879 for 17010 kcal (list not available right now though
= just a hair over 1 dollar per DoFE

I'd like average prices,.
FRED has price indices for particular goods. 
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=10&eid=34561#snid=34571
But I want actual dollar per unit prices.

Gasoline would be an even cheaper source of food if you could eat it.
([You cannot. Do not try. You will die.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0RmB62MFU8&t=16s))
A gallon of gas contains a bit over 15 DoFE.[^gasEnergy]
At /$3.62 per gallon,[^gasPrice]
that works out to less than 25 cents per DoFE.

<aside>
Vegetable oil has roughly the same energy density as gasoline,
and a cup of oil or gasoline each contain about 1 DoFE.
Could you eat nothing but canola oil for two weeks?
That's not <i>as</i> bad an idea as trying to live on a gallon of gasoline. 
Still a pretty bad idea, though.
</aside>

[^gasEnergy]: [According to this page from the EIA](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/), a gallon of finished motor gasoline with 10 percent ethanol contains 120 thousand BTU.

[^gasPrice]: [Average Price of Gasoline, All types, US City Average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU00007471A): 3.622 dollars in February 2023. 

<!--
A gallon of gasoline (with 10 percent ethanol)
[contains 120k BTU](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/units-and-calculators/),
which converts to 15 DoFE.
If your body could get energy from gasoline,
([It cannot. Do not try. You will die.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0RmB62MFU8&t=16s))
then a single gallon would be enough food for two weeks.

A uranium fuel pellet contains the same amount of energy as 149 gal of oil?
https://css.umich.edu/publications/factsheets/energy/nuclear-energy-factsheet
How much is that though?

1 ton can produce more than 40 million kwh
https://web.evs.anl.gov/uranium/guide/facts/

This site gives 80,000,000 MJ/kg
https://whatisnuclear.com/energy-density.html
so 80k MJ per gram

xkcd gives a similar number at 76 million MJ per kg
https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1162:_Log_Scale
This 76000000 figure can be converted to get the 18mil Cal figure that floats around.

Wikipedia mentions a theoretical output of up to 20 terajoules per kg
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium
That's 20,000,000 megajoules.
Why the discrepancy?

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/
Current tech will deplete estimated reserves in 230 years at current consumption.
fuel recycling could double that.
Breeder reactors would extend reserves to 30k years (by reducing raw fuel use to 1 percent).
Alternatively, some magic tech that extracts U from seawater would increase reserves to last for 60k years with current tech.
So combining the two would leave... 6,000,000 years of energy?
Nice.

https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/the-nuclear-fuel-cycle.php

A single gram of uranium fuel produces over 172 DoFE of electricity in a typical reactor,[^uraniumEnergy]
and up to 9500 DoFE (26 years of food energy) could be theoretically produced. 
A single DoFE could be provided by a speck of Uranium the size of a grain of sand
(in a reactor; do not eat uranium).

[^uraniumEnergy]: [One metric ton of low-enriched uranium generates 400 million kWh of electricity in a light water reactor.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/) So 1 gram produces 400 kWh ≈ 340 thousand Cal ≈ 172 DoFE. But light water reactors only extract around 5 percent of the energy from the fuel. [According to this page](https://whatisnuclear.com/energy-density.html), a gram of Uranium can release 79 thousand megajoules ≈ 9500 DoFE

<!--
A single gram of uranium fuel produces over 17 thousand DoFE of electricity,[^uraniumEnergy]
roughly the same amount of energy burned by a human body from 47 years worth of food.
The amount of uranium needed to produced 365 DoFE would be the size of a grain of sand.
(Though if you actually ate a gram of uranium, you'd be able to go without eating for the rest of your life.)


https://web.evs.anl.gov/uranium/guide/ucompound/health/index.cfm
Don't eat uranium. Definitely not a gram.

Numbers match up with this, assuming the pellet is 9-10 grams:

17million btu is about 5000 kWh

One gram of antimatter, reacting with one gram of matter,
would release over 20 million DoFE.[^antimatterenergy]
(Honestly, that's less than I expected. Sci-fi has made me overestimate the power of antimatter.)
If only people could eat neutrinos and gamma rays,
then a mere pound of antimatter could feed the whole world.

[^antimatterenergy]: [As per Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=relativistic+mass+-energy+equivalent+of+2+grams), 2 grams of matter contains 1.80e14 Joules of relativistic energy  ≈  4.30e10 Cal ≈ 2.15e7 DoFE. Similarly, 2 pounds of matter contain ≈ 9.75 billion DoFE.

Comparisons to explosions are the easiest to make,
since a "ton of TNT", as a unit of energy, 
is *exactly* equal to 500 DoFE (one million Cal). 
A megaton blast is equal to 500 million DoFE, 
which is roughly the amount of food energy consumed by Americans each day.[^USEnergy]

[^USEnergy]: [334.8 million people](https://www.census.gov/popclock/) times 3000 dietary Calories (1.5 DoFE) each: That gives 502.2 DoFE, essentially one megaton of TNT equivalent. Is 3000 Cal a reasonable estimate? [This page from Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/food-supply) plots data showing the US consumes 3800 Cal per person each day, but that's "consumption" in the economic sense. [This paper](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/90/6/1453/4598059) mentions an estimate of 2895 Cal intake per day for adults in the years 1999-2000, but says food waste makes this very difficult to measure. My guess is that 3000 Cal is an overestimate, but not an absurd one.

Lazily pulling some examples from [the wikipedia page on TNT equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent): 
- Mount Saint Helens: 24 ~~Megatons~~ days of American food consumption
- Tsar Bomba: 55 ~~Megatons~~ days of American food consumption
- Krakatoa: 200 ~~Megatons~~ days of American food consumption
- All nukes ever detonated, combined: 540 ~~Megatons~~ days of American food consumption

but please don't try to eat antimatter or atomic bombs,...

Now time for some very depressing comparisons!
The Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed ~125 thousand people.
At 15 kilotons, that's 7.5 million DoFE
125k * 60 DoFE = amount of energy released in the blast.
So the victims of the bomb would have released about the same amount of energy

Too depressing for a light-hearted blogpost?

## Power usage

- A watt (W) is 1 joule per second. 
- The "standard" adult needs 2000 dietary Calories per day.
- There are 86400 seconds in a day.

Combine these conversions to find that 2000 Cal per day is about the same as 97 watts. 
I'll round that up to 100 watts, and call it 1 "Manpower".[^horsepowercomparison]

[^horsepowercomparison]: It's the amount of power needed to fuel a man. Contrast with "Horsepower", which is the power that a horse can apply while tugging on a rope to lift things. Note also: [this webpage](https://www.pedalpc.com/blog/how-much-electricity-can-human-generate/) claims that a typical untrained person can exert around 100 watts of power via pedalling. So the idea of calling 100 watts "1 ManPower" works on multiple levels.

We can then conceptualize the power use of appliances in terms of person-equivalents.

| Appliance | ManPower |
|:-:|:-:|
| Microwave Oven | 6-13 |
| Electric Kettle (US) | 15 | 
| Space Heater | 15 | 
| Gaming PC | 5 | 


Note that these are comparisons of the rate of power usage. Not comparisons of the daily energy usage.
Most people don't leave their tea kettles running 24 hours a day.
